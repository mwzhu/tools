There\u2019s been other updates on my page showing their progress.\n\nWe started this series to see what happens when real people try things the fitness and recovery world keep bringing up, like BPC and TB. No hype and no promises, just real life.\n\nSo far, my parents have been sleeping better, moving easier, and noticing less day to day discomfort. And because feelings can be subjective, we have been monitoring their blood pressure. Those numbers shifted over these 10 days too.\n\nThis is not about telling anyone what to use. I am simply documenting what happens inside my own family and letting you watch it for yourself.\n\nEpisode 3 will cover my dad\u2019s cancer history and why that matters for this entire series.

    "transcript": "It's been 10 days now since I started my Indian parents on peptides and the difference in how they move and feel surprised me. I'm just gonna let them talk and share what their experience has been like since we started. Hello everyone, after the first injection my knees are painless and I'm improving day by day and I sleep at night time very nice. When I wake up in the morning my body is not aching. That's important for me. Hello everyone, my arthritis symptoms are much better. I have less tingles on my hand and less back pain. One thing we noticed with my mom is when we inject her in the morning, the tingles in her hands comes back at night so we may start splitting her doses. We've also been monitoring their blood pressure. My dad's blood pressure was higher on day one which makes sense because he's naturally a stressed person and he likes to have a drink every night. After checking again 10 days later at the same time of the day, his blood pressure dropped significantly. Even my mom's numbers were a bit high to begin with but after day 10 they improved. I'm not making any claims or telling anyone what to do. I'm just documenting what's happening with my parents in real time and letting their words and numbers explain themselves. Episode 3 we're gonna dive into my dad's cancer history so stay tuned."

You got me fucked up if you think I'm gonna sacrifice my health for a goddamn nanny car. That's some pussy shit. I had a career ending knee injury. I was supposed to be out for one whole year. I cut my recovery time in half using BPC, the Wolverine stack, and people are finally catching on. Everyone's using this stuff because at the end of the day, it's just amino acids. Obviously, there's more to it than that. But when you look at this stuff, you got to look to the risk to reward ratio. And it's pretty rewarding for not a lot of risk. I was supposed to be in a fucking wheelchair. I utilize BPC. I'm back to doing pro wrestling, boxing, going in the gym, hitting legs like a boss. And of course, putting your girl in doggies. Don't put your health at risk because someone else is a pussy. And they're gonna tell you, oh, you're gonna lose your nanny car. If you're not a fitness influencer, it doesn't matter. You can be a fake nanny because it's nobody else's business. If you'd like to see my personal recovery protocol and what I use, comment the word heel down below and I'll send you the full doc."

    "transcript": "Retitrutide has mostly been talked about for weight loss, but there's a study that came out this year that talks about how it affects cancer progression. This paper is from March of 2025, and it hasn't gone viral, but I wanna see what the researchers were trying to understand here. The effects of retitrutide on metabolic changes related to tumor progression and development, specifically in pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma. And so that makes a lot of sense because we already know obesity leads to many other diseases, but what do they find in this study? Retitrutide decreased tumor engraftment, delayed tumor onset, and reduced tumor growth over time. So fewer tumors found, they showed up later, and they grew much slower. So was this just a mechanism of weight loss, or did the study account for other things there? In this study, they also compared it to semiglutide as a separate group, but what they did do was they had calorie-restricted and weight-matched groups, and retitrutide showed far better tumor suppression than the other groups. Retitrutide did so through increasing antigen-presenting cells, decreasing immunosuppressive cells, and increasing pro-inflammatory pathways related to tumor progression. So then what happened after they stopped the drug in some models? Even after stopping retitrutide, we saw in the control groups that tumor progression was slower. All right, so this is some pretty cool data. Now, how should we interpret this result, and what does this mean for cancer? This doesn't mean that retitrutide is a cancer treatment like chemotherapy. It only means that mediating the metabolic health and immune function can positively affect cancer outcomes. Now, retitrutide still needs to be tested for human cancer progression. However, this is a good starting point, and this is how science should be talked about. Cool, calm, and collected. Just interpreting data."

What are you looking to improve? Like for example, if you're looking for better skin, better overall tissue health, there's a copper peptide like GHKCU. If you want to shred down fat loss, appetite control, we got RETATURE TIDE, injury recovery joint muscle repair, we got BPC 157 and TB 500. When getting into peptide, syringes and backwater can be a little bit of the intimidating part, but it's super simple. They're available on Amazon. You're looking for insulin syringes and backwater. Reconstitutioning peptides sounds scary, but it's literally just a YouTube search away. Storage for your peptides does matter. So just make sure that you're storing them in the fridge. Now as peptides have also become a massive trend, you need to make sure that what you're getting is legitimate, a reliable source, high purity.

    "transcript": "It could be the most powerful weight loss medication that we have. Those are my thoughts on Ritartritide. It's still in clinical trials though. It's the first of its kind. It's Eli Lilly's Triple G. It's a triple agonist for three different receptors, GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. 48 week phase two trial showed a greater than 24% weight loss, which is more than any of the other medications that we have. The really cool part was that there was no plateau. And so the speculation is that were the trial to have continued longer, people would have kept losing more weight. Another really cool thing about Ritartritide is it appears to just melt liver fat right off. A sub study was completed on the people who had fatty liver disease. Those taking Ritartritide 12 milligram lost over 80% of their liver fat on average. So this all sounds amazing, but I am also anxious to see the safety data from the phase three trials, especially the cardiac data. In the phase two trial, there was an unexpected amount of people who experienced cardiac arrhythmias. This is not something that we've seen with our other GLP-1 medications available. Arrhythmias is a pretty vague term. And so when that was reported, that could have meant palpitations. It could have meant the heart rate was going slightly faster. One person who experienced arrhythmia did have a concerning arrhythmia called QT prolongation. That person was also taking Zofran, which can have the side effect of QT prolongation. So hopefully it's just not related, but if it is a side effect, we would definitely want to know that. So we will have to see what the phase three trials show."

Mark my words on this. I believe it will be as common as people taking an energy drink, a creatine supplement, or a pre-workout. But there's a ton of questions in the industry. People are asking, which peptide should I take? How much should I take? How long should I take? And this is what's happening. The FDA, the old trusted federal government, does not want you to be the best version of yourself. If you don't believe that, look at men's testosterone over the last 50 years. They're trying to reduce your vitality, reduce your critical thinking, and reduce the overall weaponization of your being that you have. So they're gonna try to make things illegal that will fix you and get you off of pharmaceuticals. Peptides like BPC-157 are absolutely incredible at healing the body, but they're hard to find now besides the research-only category, because the FDA wants you on pills and going to medical facilities. Research-use-only peptides are what I am currently using to research on my own body. It is something that I am encouraging, coaching my friends to use. Or you can take the route of going to a medical hormone doctor, paying three or four times the price and buying peptides from a pharmaceutical company.

The BPC 157 and TB 500 are hands down the best for recovery, injuries, inflammation, all of those things. Then you go over to the health, which is glutathione, NAD+. It's gonna detoxify like your liver. NAD+, is massive for anti-aging and everything else. You can't go wrong with those two. Then you got the Tessamerelin and the IGF-1. Bro, the Lamborghini of peptides right there. When you're looking to burn fat, build muscle, have better recovery, better sleep, that's the ticket right there. So that's my protocol with Transcend.

Steroids add synthetic hormones into your body to push strength, size, and performance past your natural limits. They work, but they also shut down your body's natural hormone production. So when you stop, you have to cycle off and let your body recover. That recovery can take weeks or months, and most people need a post-cycle therapy just to go back to normal. Peptides don't function like that at all. They don't replace your hormones, they don't shut anything down, and you don't need a post-cycle therapy. They're just signals. They tell your body to repair tissue, build collagen, improve recovery, enhance fat metabolism, or sleep better using what your body already knows. Steroids override your biology. Peptides amplify it. Now I'm not saying one is right or wrong, but just understand what both of them are before you throw them in the same basket.

Reda is one of the most advanced metabolic peptides we have right now. It works across multiple pathways, hunger, blood sugar, and fat loss. In the simplest terms for anybody to understand, it will help control those cravings, it will stabilize how your body uses energy, and improves fat burning efficiency. This also ties into a couple mental aspects as well. Mentally, your energy is smoother, your focus feels cleaner, and you're not battling your appetite all day. And on top of all these sick aspects, it's actually really good for improving key blood markers, things like fasting glucose, insulin sensitivity, triglycerides, and overall metabolic health. So at the end of the day, your body isn't just losing fat, building muscle, all the cool aspects of Reda. It's actually functioning better internally.

    "transcript": "Big Pharma doesn't want you to know that there's a peptide stack that may help support heart health better than most prescriptions. These peptides don't just help enhance blood flow, they help to reduce inflammation, may help repair blood vessels, and could protect your heart at the cellular level. Here's the stack I recommend for longevity and cardiovascular protection. I'm Dr. Voss, Longevity Doctor with an MD from Cornell. You can protect your heart using tools that go way beyond pills. People think of peptides as a fitness or an anti-aging tool, but their real power may be in disease prevention, especially for the heart. This peptide stack focuses on inflammation, vascular health, and cellular repair, which are three core pillars of cardiovascular longevity. First is BPC157. This peptide is best known for its role in gut health and soft tissue healing, but emerging preclinical evidence suggests that may also support endothelial repair by promoting angiogenesis and reducing oxidative stress. Since endothelial dysfunction is an early step in atherosclerosis, BPC157's potential vascular effects could be beneficial for cardiovascular disease. Second is Thymosin Beta-4, often called Thompson Beta-500. This is another powerful healing peptide. It has been shown to improve angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels, which is critical for recovery after tissue damage. It also appears to reduce fibrosis, which is the hardening of tissues that can impair function. Third is epitalin. This is a lesser known peptide that helps to support pineal gland function and telomere repair. While it's often discussed in longevity circles, there is growing interest in its potential to reduce oxidative stress in cardiovascular tissue. Fourth is GHKCU. This copper binding peptide has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and tissue regenerative properties in preclinical studies. It also plays a role in angiogenesis, appears to potentially improve oxygen utilization at the cellular level. You don't take these peptides forever. Most of the time these are used in cycles, anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks in length, depending on the goal. They can be administered via sub-Q injection or early in the case of BPC, and some have been used intravenously. Are peptides a replacement for lifestyle? But they can accelerate repair, especially in people recovering from inflammation or metabolic issues that can put strain on the heart. The truth is that naturally occurring peptides will never be advertised the way statins are, because you can't patent your body's naturally occurring signaling molecules. But in my opinion, when used correctly and clinically monitored, they're one of the most powerful tools that we have. If you have any questions on this topic, let me know in the comments."

    "transcript": "So it has now been two weeks of my dad being on BPC 157 and now TB 500. He just started off with BPC 157 in the beginning for the first five days. But now I have him on TB 500 as well. As always, though, please get your blood work done beforehand, during and afterwards. If you want to be 100 percent safe, that is what he has been doing the entire time. When it comes to BPC, what do you think you've noticed the most in terms of like the recovery benefits? The gut healing is amazing and the alleviation of just the pain from my hips and all is a lot better. The but yeah, the gut parts, what's impressed me the most because I didn't expect that. That was an unexpected pleasure. I'll be honest, I completely forgot to even tell him about the gut related benefits, but yeah, if you have bad gut health, BPC is incredible for that. Also, I want to say he is now on reticulotide to try to get below 200 pounds at five foot nine. And he's also going to be increasing his T.R.T. injections once every few days and trying to do it twice a week rather than once every two weeks, because for how long now? Like two years, three years. You've been doing once every two weeks for T.R.T. Three years. And I realize that now, which is not good at all. So we're fixing a lot of things. I'm telling you guys right now, the transformation is going to be absolutely insane. Stay tuned over the next few months. You guys will see for yourselves."

    "transcript": "This is the secret peptide stack that millionaires and high performers are using so they can work harder than you and be smarter than you. It's four compounds. Save this video for reference and gatekeep it from all your friends so you become smarter and richer than all of them. Okay, the first one is some Max. Now, I've compared this to Adderall before. I'll explain the similarities and I'll explain the differences. So, boost B at ANF, which results in faster thinking. It gives you mental clarity and it's great for working long hours. You get a sustained work rate. When you take it, it is not as strong as Adderall. Adderall is far more stimulating, but it gives you about 40 to 50% of the effects and there's no horrible crash. There's no horrible dehydration and it's not one chemical compound removed from being math. Next up, we got Dyehexa, which is a brain builder, improves cognition, memory, all that good stuff. Anything you want to learn, you can learn faster with the use of Dyehexa. Next up is Salang. It calms you down, gets rid of all those jitters. Let's say you have an exam coming up. You think clearly under pressure, but a lot of people say this one is very mild. It doesn't work for them. I notice it works, but maybe it doesn't for you. And next up, the last thing is Bromantane. This gives you a shit ton of motivation and drive. It up regulates that dopamine and boosts dopamine production so you feel absolutely dialed in doing work. The only problem I've noticed with this is if I take it too late, I get a little bit of insomnia, but I'm a very busy guy. I use all this stuff to get all my work done at a high level. Many of your favorite entrepreneurs, influencers, or just people you look up to, utilize these peptides. If you want a free guide on how to use this stuff, where to get it, how to dose it, comment the word work down below."

I mean, GLP ones are relatively new. How do I know I'm not going to fucking fall over dead? Well, luckily for you, I've actually stopped taking it after about four weeks now of not taking any red at true tide. A GLP one, one of the best ones out there. Had some interesting results. First of all, my pumps in the gym, like my ability to train well and get pumps and actually perform my best. Is much higher. Like it kind of felt as if I was being held back like 20% in the gym when I was taking red at true tide. I think this could be some of the glucagon agonism, but I'm not so sure. The other thing is my hunger. It's still not there. I'm like honestly not hungry 99% of the time, even without it having been in my system now for some time. It's almost as if it has given me some sort of permanent relief of hunger. Maybe my stomach has shrunk just from not eating as much as I normally used to or something else. I'm not so sure, but it is definitely interesting. Lastly, a really important piece of information, my depression still exists. So that's kind of fucked."

    "transcript": "What's up guys, I'm going to tell you my personal stack and I'm going to break down why I'm taking everything I'm currently taking. So number one, I'm taking testosterone and antate. Testosterone should be the base of any protocol. The only difference between an antate and sipionate, which is another common ester, is the half-life. An antate has about a four to five day half-life where sipionate is seven to ten days. For me, I just feel a little better on an antate. There's not a huge difference, but for me, I felt a little less water retention and a better overall sense of well-being. The second thing I'm currently taking is tessemerone. The reason why I'm taking that is because I want to optimize my IGF-1 growth hormone levels. IGF-1 and testosterone are two major hormones that work synergistically together to optimize fat loss and muscle building. Also going to get anti-aging effects and improve sleep quality, often increase IGF-1 as well. Third thing I'm taking currently is anavar, aka oxangelone. I'm taking this because I'm currently in a caloric deficit and anavar allows you to retain not only strength but muscle while in the deficit. Another advantage is that it does not aromatize, meaning it doesn't convert into estrogen, so I don't have to worry about any E2 issues there. It also lowers SHBG so you will have more free testosterone in your bloodstream. The fourth thing I'm taking is a combination of TB500 and pentadecapeptide. Most people know that as similar to BPC157. The main benefits of these two peptides combined, aka the Wolverine stack, is they reduce overall systemic inflammation. TB500 specializes in the reduction of inflammation in the tendons and joints, whereas pentadecapeptide is going to help you with issues in the soft tissue area of the muscle. All right, guys, last but not least we have Reddit True Tide. Reddit is a triple hormone receptor agonist. So it has GOP1, glucagon, and GIP. What does that mean? It's going to reduce food noise. It's going to help you regulate your blood sugar levels and it's going to get you guys insanely shredded. I've said it in my prior videos, it's probably the best peptide I've ever taken to cut weight. Let me know your guys' thoughts on my stack. Comment your stack below. Look forward to"

    "transcript": "Alright guys, here's some things you should know before you start taking reddit fruit diet. So yes, food noise does go out the window, but this is where most people mess up. They stop eating enough protein and miss their essential nutrients. If you want to maximize your results, minimum 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight. Shit doesn't change. In terms of dosing, you want to start low. My personal recommendation, what I've personally done is I've started at 1 milligram per week. I've spread them out into 2, 0.5 on a Sunday, 0.5 on a Thursday. From there, you then gradually increase. Starting off slow also reduces those minimal side effects that some people might be feeling. A little bit of nausea, an upset stomach. But don't freak out. It's pretty common and usually tends to fade away. I never even felt them in the first place. Another thing is training. Reddit fruit diet might help you maintain that muscle on a weight loss phase, but it's not going to build it for you. The thing with reddit is compared to other drugs like Ozempic that only hit the GLP-1 pathway, reddit fruit diet activates three, GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. And in simple terms, a combination of all three means better fat loss, better appetite control and better muscle retention. And improvements on things like fasting glucose, inflammation markers, and overall metabolic health. Reddit is an absolutely insane tool if you use it correctly. Just make sure you're fueling your body right, you're dosing it smart, and you're training hard. If you're looking for a trusted, reliable source, feel free to shoot me a DM."

Breaking this combo down in the simplest term, GHK, your skin plus hair peptide, more collagen, better elasticity, healthier healing, and overall that glow people talk about. BPC is your internal repair system. It helps with the gut health, reduces inflammation, and speeds up recovery from training or stress. TB 500 works deeper, tissue repair, joint recovery, mobility healing at a muscular level. Now when you stack all three, your body simply functions better. Your skin looks healthier, you recover faster, inflammation drops, and you just feel fucking repaired. The Glow Blend for me has been one of the most noticeable things I've added. My skin got clear, recovery improved, and day to day inflammation is way lower. And that's the piece people struggle to understand is that this is not just cosmetic, these peptides actually support your internal healing.

    "transcript": "All right, let's piss some people off. Here we go. If you're using one peptide You're really just throwing your money away. Peptides were never designed to work solo and Amateurs take one peptide. Remember peptides are not just gonna magically work, right? There's signals and those signals need to be stacked correctly to have the right sequence to work First example is we'll talk about CJC 1295 or some more when you take it by itself You get a little bit of a GH pulse, but you're not taking with a GR GH RP like I per melon or GH RP to It's pointless. You're not amplifying the signal. So basically nothing's gonna happen The second example is talking about the healing peptides BBC 157 TV 500, right? BBC 157 repairs a tissue to 500 boost up your healing time when you stack them together You heal faster you heal deeper and you actually repair the tissue You're not just masking inflammation by taking one peptide This is exactly why one peptide will not work that well It'll work but not to its fullest potential right your body doesn't work in one lane There's multiple lanes going on we're talking about recovery hormones metabolism. They're all connected This is why it's important to stack multiple peptides. You get multiple systems helping So yeah If you're running one peptide at a time and you're complaining that it doesn't work you waste your money on they're overpriced the scam It's not the peptides fault. It's your fault because you're not stacking smart. You're not paying attention to the signals you don't even understand your biology and Why the shit ain't working?"

Well, basically it's the reason why I look like this while going out and not tracking my calories to sum it up It makes dieting a breeze it suppresses food noise and it turns your body into a furnace your Metabolism is through the roof and you're constantly burning calories and 90% of the time being attractive just comes down to being a lean So reddit will have you covered in that department, but wait clearly this guy from reddit is more attractive But why is that he's not leaner, but he's also tanner having a nice tan is a strong signal of health and attractiveness It's going to give a leaner sharper appearance add more contrast and definition to your facial features and muscle as well Mt2 binds to melano corin receptors increasing melanin synthesis. Therefore making you darker often giving results like this I've personally only taken it for a few days, but I did not look like this before Lastly gh kcu the copper peptide the pretty boy peptide Whatever you want to call it what it does is it stimulates collagen production? Not only does that help with skin firmness texture and tone But it also works from the inside out reducing inflammation and neutralizing oxidative stress and clear skin just becomes a by-product of that You see I broke out when I was in volley due to the pollution and also humidity which I wasn't used to But I came back locked in the gh kcu megados v5 and stuck to only whole foods and now But this skin is looking a lot better.

    "transcript": "People say peptides like BPC and TB can cause cancer. My dad had lung cancer, so I actually looked into it instead of just repeating the fear online. The fear usually comes from one word, angiogenesis. That just means forming new blood vessels. Your body does this all the time. When you exercise, walk, lift weights, heal from soreness, or recover from an injury, your body increases a signal called VEGF. That's normal biology. If angiogenesis caused cancer, then athletes and active people would be at constant risk. And that's just not what we see in real life. BPC and TB interact with healing pathways your body already uses. They just amplify signals that already happen during normal recovery. And it's not one-sided. There are studies showing anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and even anti-tumor activity in certain models. Now that doesn't mean treatment or prevention. It just means the science is more nuanced than fear-based posts make it sound. This matters to me because my dad had lung cancer years ago. He had surgery, part of his lung removed, and he's been followed closely ever since. He has gone through regular imaging and screenings over the years and was just re-screened recently. And everything has been stable and clear. At no point did any doctor warn him against exercise, walking, or lifestyle habits that naturally increase VEGF. Because angiogenesis is a part of healing, not a switch that turns cancer on. I'm not telling anyone what to take, I'm explaining the science, the context, and why this conversation deserves more nuance."

The reason I take injectable L-Carnitine is because it simply helps your body shuttle fatty acids into the mitochondria. In easy terms, basically turning stored fat into fuel. So by taking it, you're literally improving how efficiently your body uses energy. Mentally, it's a game changer. I'm sharper, I'm more clear, and physique-wise, it helps me stay leaner, increases endurance, and even supports recovery because of how it improves mitochondrial health. So if you've never tried it and you're serious about optimizing your energy, fat metabolism, and focus, injectable L-Carnitine is one of the smartest additions you can add to your stack."

Most people come off glp once and gain back all the weight they initially lost because they don't understand that when you're shredding it comes to a point where your metabolism starts to slow down and adjust to your lower intake. So if you just randomly cut the reddit out from your peak dose, you're giving your body the green light to just let your hunger shoot straight through the roof a lot quicker than your metabolism can catch up. Or you even know it, but you're not going to lose that much weight. So listen, from your peak dose, titrate down, split it in half about every two to four weeks. At the same time, stay consistent to what you were eating in order to lose the fat, incorporate more carbs pre and post workout, and use them to your advantage in the gym. This is not the time to slack off a protein either, so keep that high too. This would also be a great time to implement other peptides like MOTC, SLUPP332, and Tessamerelin to increase insulin sensitivity and fat oxidation. And that's the teaching your body how to become fuel efficient long term so you can use these tools, get the benefits, get lean and never rebound."

No, he said peptides, which is super specific And I was surprised so I asked him, you know, what made him guess peptides and he said the main thing was skin And I kind of get why because i'm not like the biggest guy and two things stand out being lean and being tan I think it really goes to show who peptides are really good for people that want more of a healthy optimized look instead of that Me head, you know roided look I want to be right in the middle But that's why it's important to know what you're taking and why you're taking it for your goals"

    "transcript": "L-Carnitine for muscle gain and fat loss, but in order to achieve these results through oral L-Carnitine, you'd have to damn near drink the entire bottle every day. And that comes with its own issues. That's because oral L-Carnitine barely gets absorbed. Most of what you take never even gets used. Injectable L-Carnitine is different. It's fully bioavailable, meaning your body actually uses everything you take. So what you can expect is your body will use fat as fuel instead of burning through muscle glycogen. That means you burn more body fat, your muscles stay fuller, and your metabolic rate stays higher. It also improves insulin sensitivity and blood flow, which means better pumps, better performance, and better recovery. It even helps your muscles respond better to training and hormones instead of breaking down from hard sessions. That's why people use L-Carnitine to stay lean in the off-senescent and hold muscle while cutting."

Start at 0.5 milligrams per week, stay there for two to three weeks, and from there, gradually increase by 0.5 until you've found your maintenance dose. Starting low and gradually increasing also minimizes the potential for those minimal side effects some people feel. Now in terms of how long you should be running it, Reddit TrueTide isn't just a lose weight stock and pray it doesn't come back drug. It actually supports metabolic function, how your body handles insulin, stores fat and regulates energy. Clinical trials have gone upwards of 48 weeks and people didn't just lose the fat. Their biomarkers actually improved. Better insulin sensitivity, improved fasting glucose, and healthier liver markers. Super long-term data past a couple years is still being studied. But we technically don't have the take it forever answer yet, but taking it long-term, especially at a lower dose, makes a lot of sense, especially for metabolic support, not just extreme fat loss. For continuous health and longevity tips, give me a follow."

And don't get me wrong, if you run the Chris Hemsworth physique, it's going to take a lot more than just a drug that you shoot in your belly every week to look like this. But when guys like Channing Tatum go from 2235 to 172 for movie roles, you know they're doing more than just some cardio and lifting some weights every week. Now, I don't think you need drugs to look like this. But if there's an advantage out there these days besides TRT, I would say it's peptides. And when you pair that up with the proper program, the right coaching and accountability, the right environment so that you are successful, well, it's a match made in heaven. I put together a whole guide and I'm saying it might be worth looking into.

At that point, this stopped feeling like me pushing something and started feeling like them taking ownership. So I wanted to give a one month update on where things actually stand. Over the past month, we've made small but deliberate changes. We've also paid attention to how their bodies respond. Right now my dad is on the Wolf Rain Stack as his main focus for joint comfort and recovery. About a week ago, we also introduced NAD for him as a part of the bigger picture. My mom also started on the Wolf Rain Stack. After about two weeks, we switched her to the Cloblen so she could utilize the KPV for her arthritis. We're still trying to see if that makes sense for her long term or maybe just switch her back to the Wolf Rain Stack on top of KPV. And on top of the peptides, of course I've made sure that my parents have been staying active and doing their regular walks and yoga every morning. Movement is consistent, diet is clean, and activity isn't something I have to remind them about. Another important shift is oversight. I now have a doctor reviewing their labs and health history alongside what we're doing. That matters, especially when the long term goal is to simplify things over time and not keep adding more. This series isn't about chasing tools. It's about responsibility, awareness, and making adjustments based on real feedback over time. More updates coming as we keep tracking, adjusting, and moving forward."

    "transcript": "What's up guys, I'm gonna tell you some of the common side effects of some of the peptides and hormones that I'm taking and what you can take and do to stop and mitigate these side effects. Alright guys, so number one testosterone, one of the major issues is hair loss, right? The reason for that is that testosterone is a DHT derived compound. Increased DHT, if you're susceptible to it can cause hair loss and overall unhealthy scalp. So what can you do to mitigate this? You can take GH copper, which is a good peptide to take, you can take it topically, you can inject it, it's going to help your hair grow back stronger, it's going to help your hair last longer. You can also take a mixture of finasteride and minoxidil, which is another combination that essentially does the same thing in terms of hair health. Another side effect of testosterone is estrogen, it does aromatize, so some people aromatize at a higher rate. You don't want too much aromatization because excess estrogen can cause issues, so if you really need to, you can take an AI like an acidol that will block estrogen or you can actually lower your dose and inject more often during the week. That can also help mitigate some of these estrogen issues. Third side effect of testosterone is elevated hemoglobin, that essentially means that your blood is getting too thick. How can you mitigate this? You can do blood donations, I do my donation every six months or so. Another thing that's overlooked is hydration, right? Hydrating is actually very crucial while being on TRT. It can help mitigate this side effect as well. Okay, so number two, I'm going to put these peptides and hormones in the same category, growth hormone and test pereline. Both of these can increase insulin resistance if done incorrectly. So if you eat too close to putting these hormones or peptides, so if you have a meal like say within 30 minutes, especially a high carb or high sugar meal, you're going to increase insulin resistance and you do not want that. How can you avoid this? Make sure you are fasted. For me, I'd like to have a two hour rule. I don't eat two hours until pinning. Also try to avoid meals that are higher carbs or higher sugar when you're pinning these hormones because that can increase insulin resistance as well. Number three, Anivar aka oxangelone. One of the major issues with this is that it passes through the liver. That can mean that you have elevated liver enzymes, which are going to be your ALT and AST levels. How can you mitigate this? Well, I take Tudco, which is an oral supplement you can get. Another thing that you can do is inject glutathione. Glutathione is a very powerful antioxidant peptide that's going to cleanse your body, primarily your liver. Alright guys, last but not least, retichutide. So two of the major side effects that people experience are increased heart rate and nausea at the very beginning. This is probably because they're doing too much, right? So how I recommend to do is I would start with higher exposure, lower amounts. So if I were to start, I would do maybe three pins in a week. Very small amount to get your body accustomed to it. And that way you can slowly progress and tie trade up as needed. So guys, those are the four things that I'm currently taking and some of the common side effects. Let me know if you have any questions about any other medications. I would be glad to answer them in the DMs or in the comments. Thank you."

Most people are under the assumption that reddit is just some weight loss drug where you lose the weight you come off and just Pray it doesn't come back, but it's actually a lot fucking cooler than that It retains your metabolism how your body stores fat how it handles insulin from what we know so far Most clinical trials have lasted up to 48 weeks people handled it pretty fucking well in this study It shows that not only did they lose fat But their biomarkers actually came back better even while taking it up to 48 weeks things like healthier liver markers improve insulin sensitivity Better fasting glucose and I can just keep going on and on and on long-term safety past one or two years is still being studied So keep that in mind. So can you stay on it forever? Technically? We don't know yet low doses long term. I think You're pretty soft, especially if your intentions aren't hyper fixated on fat loss And instead you're simply supporting better insulin function and metabolic efficiency Which are things that your body already naturally does research purposes only not for medical advice"

I wanted an option that was easy, something I could do in my apartment. I reached out to this company called Ageless RX. I want to tell you guys, I have never been a morning person my entire life. And for the first time ever, I'm waking up at 7 a.m. Barely drink coffee now. I'll have like a cup and a half. I used to be at like four or five cups a day. We'll show you guys how I inject it. I'm using my arm as an example, but typically you're going to pinch a piece of your body fat on your stomach or maybe your thigh before injecting the prescribed units. NAD helps with overall brain function and cellular repair while Glutathione works.

    "transcript": "New Phase 3 reddata just dropped, and I brought in a medical professional to talk about why it's significant for weight loss and joint pain. This is from Eli Lilly's Triumph 4 Phase 3 trial. Adults with knee osteoarthritis and obesity were followed for 68 weeks. The average starting weight was around 250 pounds and the average reported BMI was around 40. Now we all know BMI isn't a perfect metric and it doesn't tell us body composition or body fat distribution. But at this level it clearly represents a severely obese population with real metabolic and joint stress. Now at the highest dose of 12 mg once weekly, which is a very high dose by the way, participants lost up to 28.7% of their body weight, averaging over 70 pounds. To explain why Phase 3 data like this actually matters, here's Dr. Tuhin Chaudhry. Rahul, thank you so much for having me and thank you for the kind introduction. I'm Dr. Chaudhry, I'm a hospitalist turned wellness physician, and I wanted to discuss the Triumph 4 study with you. It was the gold standard with a randomized double-blind placebo control study. We also saw that it was a Phase 3 study, which is the last phase before it gets FDA approval. The WOMAC pain scale that they used was based on knee pain defined by knee osteoarthritis, which is joint space narrowing seen on an x-ray. And we also saw that some of their dosings were a little bit higher than what we see in the researcher world. Their starting dose was 2 mg, we typically see a lot lower starting dose. And their primary endpoint of hitting that 28.7% weight loss was at the 12 mg dosing. Some of the side effects that can occur, especially at these higher dosings, are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. And we also saw about 10% of the population have dysthesia or paresthesia, which is that numbness and tingling that can occur on the skin. Thank you very much for having me. So yeah, this study didn't exactly tell us anything we didn't already know about RETTA, but it did confirm it at a Phase 3 scale. I'll keep breaking this down as more data comes out."

They tell your cells when to repair muscle, burn fat, improve sleep, regulate hormones, and support joint and skin health. The peptides people inject or supplement with are just synthetic versions of the same naturally occurring signals. Scientists copy the exact same amino acid sequence your body already uses. You're not adding a foreign chemical. You're just boosting a message your body already understands. Peptides aren't magic, they just make your body more efficient at doing what it's already supposed to do.

So something really cool happened yesterday He over trained he was playing volleyball and he came home kind of limping and Generally when this happens, he goes to the doc and he gets a cortisone shot And I told him that these peptides are not going to replace what cortisone does But we try to localize injection subq in his upper calf for the first time because we've always done subq in the belly And he felt pretty good. I'm just gonna let him talk about what happened Yes Sunday I was playing volleyball and monday I was limping all day and he gave me the injection at night time because uh, I I had a stemming pain All day and once he gave me the injection. I feel better and when I wake up at night time, I really feel uh painless free and I was painless and I was okay He was not limping today And I mean I told him i'm like this isn't going to replace a cortisone shot But it's pretty cool what the anti-inflammatory effects of these peptides can do.

It's always gonna be my stack It's not magic either This is a critical coenzyme that is found in every single one of ourselves plays a crucial role in energy Metabolism and it's vital for proper cellular function But like how does it actually feel think about the times that you were eating super healthy? You were getting eight hours of sleep getting good morning texts from an 8.7. You had low stress and everything is just dialed in That's how it feels ever since I started taking it I've had less brain fog more consistent energy even throughout the day later at night better sleep It's a bit easier to keep off fat overall just more charged up. That's what it does But as you age any D levels naturally decline That's why if you want to optimize it's important to administer it either IV or intramuscular Which is what I do and it's a lot more cost-effective doing it yourself.

    "transcript": "Taking this peptide is like drinking from the fountain of youth. Not because it stops aging, but because it supports the biology that determines how you age. GHKCU is a copper peptide that your body already produces. It plays a role in collagen signaling, skin quality, hair follicle health, tissue repair, and inflammation regulation. As natural levels drop with age, recovery slows and skin and hair health often change. Now this applies to both men and women since these pathways affect tissue quality, recovery, and resilience regardless of training style or goals. I've been using Glow for about three weeks now where GHKCU is included at a supportive, conservative dose for inflammation and recovery. I've also been using Topical GHKCU now for about three months, mainly on my face and also to target loose skin when I was cutting for my bodybuilding show. When taking signaling compounds like this, it's also important to take breaks and cycle off. Taking breaks helps keep the body responsive long term. This isn't about reversing time, it's about aging better."

    "transcript": "This might be my favorite peptide I've taken this year. After my bodybuilding show, I was nervous about my reverse diet. I had been depleted for so long that my hunger was all over the place. I knew I would need something that would help keep me grounded while my appetite and routine normalized again. As soon as I got home from the bodybuilding show, I took a dose of Retatrutide. Retat didn't erase my appetite because my body was still recovering from prep, but it definitely took the edge off. The wild part was how my physique responded. Instead of everything rushing to my waistline like I would expect, the added weight actually made my physique look better and filled me out. I used Retat at the beginning of my cut during the summer, and for the first few weeks I was actually able to gain muscle and burn fat at the same time. My pumps were fuller, I looked tighter, and it felt like my body's metabolism was working with me instead of against me. One week after my show, I crushed a Canyat combo with extra toast, and then an hour later I had a Chipotle burrito that was bleeding out the sides. Now that's not something I usually would be able to eat, and normally that would wreck me. But two weeks later, I'm only 10 pounds heavier than my stage weight, and I actually look and feel a lot better. My activity levels were also limited this week because I had a septoplasty and I wasn't allowed to work out, but I've managed to keep my weight stable.

    "transcript": "So what is the safest way to actually take peptides? Some people have said they've had bad experiences with peptides, but the main cause of this is because they do not know how to properly dose their peptide. You know, most recommended dosages come from clinical research, medical providers, and you know tolerance data based on people who have taken peptides in the past. The smartest thing you can do when taking peptides, and I recommend to everyone, is start at a low track how you respond and adjust based on how you respond. So how do I find my dose? There's tons of published studies online and human trials that have been proven to be safe for that person, but also do more research than just that. You got to know what is right for you personally. And the main thing that people mess up on, they're like, how do I know how much to, you know, draw out on my syringe? You know, how much bacteria static water do I put in it? And I will make this very clear. So go to a peptide calculator online. You know, you want to select one milliliter insulin syringe. That's the easiest. I recommend a one milliliter, but it's going to ask you how many milligrams do you have in your vial? How much backwater did you reconstitute with? And what is your desired dosage? And based off those three things, it will calculate how much you're supposed to draw out on your insulin syringe. And if you do not have those numbers to plug in, you have to do your research and figure out what's best and safest for you. Again, this is not for human consumption. This is for research purposes only. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me. I will try to get back to you all."

On the fourth rep, the bench actually slid under me because I was in the Olympic position. So a lot of force driving back and down. I just felt like a crunch in my chest. And thank God it wasn't a full tear, but it was a partial tear. Bar dropped on me. You can potentially see in the camera that there's black and blue here. That's again, two weeks old. I think two days later that I began doing peptides in a medril dose pack. Why did you turn to peptides for your injury? I've trained some pro athletes in the past and peptides were a big thing for them to get back on track. I have rehabbed probably upwards of like 50 people that had partial pectares, different strains, muscles. I know how long it can take. So doing it without peptides, I could not even raise my arm above here, couldn't go forward. Me jumping on BPC 157 and TB 500, those two peptides specifically, the Wolverine pack. I'm two weeks in and it has completely changed everything. Recovery time typically is like months. Yeah, I mean, we've got a workout in today and you were able to do like chest supported rows, use your shoulder a little bit, which is pretty crazy because this was just barely two weeks ago. And obviously it's still pretty injured. It's still pretty bruised. So you've made a lot of progress and the peptides are for sure helping with the inflammation and the improved blood flow as well, right? Yes. And he's worked with a lot of athletes with peptides. And so they definitely work for injury prevention and injury healing."

That's not because it didn't work for you, it's because you didn't take it long enough. These people that are hyping it up are lying to you when they tell you it's a three-week transformation. At the core, you're literally reprogramming cellular behavior. Cellular turnover process is going to take 21 to 30 days, but you need multiple cycles to actually see better results. So, the longer you're on it, the more new cells are made under this pro repair signaling. So the biggest waste of your time and money is taking it for like six weeks and then coming off of it. This is what the beauty filter on, I don't fucking look real. That shit works, just don't buy into the hype, actually look into it and give it time."

First few days, honestly not much, but that's to be expected because of the compounding effect. But on that fourth day, man, was at dinner with my boys and it kicked in. Telling you the sense of urgency was just so damn high that I needed to leave dinner early. You know how when they do the DUI test and you have to track the finger? If the officer would have moved it every which way, I could predict every move. So good or bad, I don't know, take that as you will. But if you need to get something done, C-max will do it. But it's not all just in jazz. I would say honestly, 85% of the time I get the true effects. But maybe 15% of the time it's a little bit more hit or miss. Like there's some people who just don't feel it. Also, a lot of people won't tell you, but if you take it before the gym, you'll notice that your energy will be high after a taxing workout and your fatigue will be low. Typically, when I would hit legs, my central nervous system would be absolutely cooked. And my ability to do hard mental tasks would just be at zero. With C-max, I can just run through workout, get home and just feel fresh. And when I'm at the gym and I'm off the C-max, something about eye contact is just so alluring. I don't know how to explain it, but I just I want to see through you. Does it give you a lot of stim like caffeine? Eh, not really. But does it give you this stoic tunnel vision focus that just kind of brings out that dog that just wants to fucking kill the task at hand? I would say so. And I know you guys will ask, so this is what he's been doing, not medical advice. But that's my honest experience on C-max. It is one of my favorite cognitive tools that I use, along with methylene blue, caffeine and alpha GBC, all that stuff."

With C-Max, he fell down and he fell focused. But with Salank, it gives a different effect. The best way I can describe it is calm and stoic. I'll give you an example. The other day, I was at downtown LA and if you've been there, you know what I'm talking about. That shit is Gotham City. It's not sunshine and rainbows. There are gangbangers, homeless people, and syringes all over the place but not for peptides. And especially driving there with the traffic, the one-ways, I'm tense. And I'm not an anxious person by any means. But I'm from the suburbs, so that shit is a cortisol spike. But I'm telling you, 500 micrograms of Salank and Gotham City might as well have been Disneyland. Those homeless people, those gangbangers might as well have been my family. I was at peace. I wasn't on edge being like, oh fuck, who's around me? I was chilling and at one point, I was in a tiny parking garage. A Tesla went around me in a one-way, like all fast. I did not get mad, no road rage, none of that. Simply thought, fuck it, bro, it's your life. Straight chillin', bro. But when do I think it would be smart to use? Before a date, before going out if you have social anxiety, before presenting a big project or business idea, or after a stressful day or a heavy workout, or you want to wind down and calm the nervous system. So I think both C-Max and Salink are great. C-Max for deep work and Salink for downtown LA and dates. And parallel parking, I'm not the biggest fan."

So I'm pretty tired from the show, but obviously we're gonna binge on a few foods but I wanted to talk about my reverse diet protocol because the reverse diet is super important because You can rebound with some negative weight really fast people do it all the time I'm gonna be using red or true tides the GLP one. I've talked about it before I've taken it before Super fun stuff. It helps with insulin sensitivity and it's also gonna suppress my appetite I'm only gonna take one dose today because I Can only have it in my system for a week because I got a septum surgery in about 10 days I'll make another video talking about that but yeah, I can't have a GLP one in my stomach for that because They don't want anything that slows down gastric emptying during the procedure I'm gonna be out of commission for like three weeks to no training. But yeah for this week We'll be using red and true tide to help So I can lift a few weights and obviously not want to eat a bunch of burgers and fries and doughnuts this whole week They usually have reverse diet protocols, but this is what red true tide is for So yeah, just two milligrams today and again use code Rahul on pro elite peptides because it helps out your boy So yeah more post show content coming soon"

And if you feel beat up and you're looking for tissue support and gut repair, BPC157 helps your body recover and keep up. And if you're dealing with chronic inflammation, aches or lingering injuries, TB500 supports full body recovery and mobility. And if your goal is better skin, hair and tissue quality, GHKCU, copper peptides support collagen and cellular repair.

    "transcript": "Chipotle's launching a GLP-1 menu, which is pretty crazy. Gearing towards a GLP-1 diet? That is totally new, Raul. There's nothing really GLP-1 about this new high protein menu they're doing. It's just a high protein menu. They're trying to play on the keyword of GLP-1 and play that into their marketing somehow, right? I would guess. I mean, right now in America, we see at least one in eight Americans have been on a GLP-1. So maybe it makes sense because there's such an emphasis on high protein diets. Plus they've been kind of robbing people on portion sizes over the past few years, right? Yeah, I keep seeing that on social media where people take videos of the low portion size of meat that they get and they can count the number of pieces of chicken. And that is kind of disappointing. So what Chipotle's essentially doing is they're trying to fix that problem by giving you the right portion size of meat, but then also charge you for it at the same time. That's true, right? People always want double portion size, but don't want to pay for it because they feel like it should be on their burrito bowl or whatever, right? Maybe other restaurants will start to follow suit and do GLP-1 menus of their own. Yeah, that'll be really interesting. I think that people already struggle to eat and get their protein intake while already being on a GLP-1. So that'll be interesting if other restaurants start doing the same. We'll have to see what other restaurants do."

My mom is 63 years old and she has severe osteoarthritis, so she's constantly having pain in her lower back and her joints. My dad is 70 years old and he also has a lot of joint pain. He plays volleyball every week and he tries to stay active, but lately his knees have been bothering him to the point where it's hard for him to move around. And classic Indian parents, they'll complain all day but refuse any help, so I stepped in. We're starting them on a low dose of BPC 157 and TB 500. I've prepared my go-to peptides for joint pain and inflammation. I've been using these peptides on and off now for almost three years and they helped me recover from meniscus tear when I thought I was done training. I would use a higher dose on myself, but because they're older and we want to get into it slowly, I'll be using 250 micrograms every other day of a BPC TB 500 blend. They get regular blood work done and we're also going to be closely monitoring their blood pressure. So this is going to be slow, controlled, and safe. All I want is for them to be able to move freely again and without pain. And if these peptides work for them the way they did for me, they might move better than half the Indian uncles at the next wedding. This is episode one. Follow along. Our generation isn't just getting fit. We're helping our parents get back into shape as well."

    "description": "TRT and steroids get thrown into the same category way too often, so I asked Alex Eubank to break down the difference. \ud83d\udc47\n\n@alex_eubank15 explains how TRT brings your testosterone back to a normal, healthy range when your body isn\u2019t producing enough. It can help with strength, confidence, mood, recovery, and overall wellbeing without pushing your hormones past what your body is designed to handle.\n\nSteroids are a whole different game. They take your levels far beyond normal, which is where you see the long term risks\u2026 hormonal shutdown, mood issues, organ stress, and a cycle your body can\u2019t realistically sustain.\n\nDialing in testosterone isn\u2019t about chasing crazy numbers. It\u2019s about feeling optimal, functioning at your best, and supporting your body instead of fighting against it.\n\nIf your levels were low, would you consider TRT or stay natural? \ud83d\udc40\n\n#fitness #bodybuilding #peptides #hormones #alexeubank #health",

    "transcript": "People give you a lot of crap for being on steroids, being on TRT, whatever it is. Can you tell us the difference between what TRT is and what steroids are? So I think it's just being super physiological. So my blood results from my testosterone last blood work was 950 nanograms or deciliter, which is in the range of what they say, like 350 to 1,000. So if that, to me, is actual replacement therapy, it's when you're exceeding the natural range. To me, that's when you're super physiological blasting gear. That's when you're taking cycles or really high dose testosterone, you're adding in other compounds to it. That's steroids to me. That's unhealthy and it's not something that you can do long term, whereas TRT is something that can actually give you more longevity. I think there's a big difference between that."

Alcohol A socially promoted, fully-legal carcinogen that damages the liver, wrecks your hormones, ruins sleep, ages your skin, and increases cancer risk. But nobody bats an eye. 5. Prescription opioids The FDA approved substances that caused the biggest addiction crisis in modern history. Highly addictive, life-destroying, and handed out like candy for years.

He's been focusing mostly on maintaining his current weights after losing the initial 40 plus pounds, as well as getting back into the gym and gaining more muscle. As you can see with his arms, go ahead and show the arm flex, he's been working out. And obviously you can see from his arms, that's where I get my arm genetics from. But like I said, he's been traveling and been really, really busy with work over the past few weeks. So he's been focusing mostly on just maintaining his current weights. But as more time goes on, he's gonna push down into the 170, eventually into the early 160s. And from there, maintain that weight for hopefully the rest of his life. And to sum up what he's been on for the entire time, he started off by using BPC 157 and TB 500 for his hip pain, and then got on Ratatouille, also known as. And he was also on TRT for three years previously. But once I started working with him, I got his TRT dose fixed because he was only doing one dose every two weeks. Now he's doing two pins a week and feels much better and has much more consistent levels. Keep in mind that none of these peptides and TRT would do anything at all if he did not focus on what he was eating every single day, getting at least 10,000 plus steps in every single day, and watching what he was eating and focusing on the higher protein, more nutrient-dense diets. With that being said, if you're an older adult looking to have a similar transformation, DM me the word coach on Instagram and we'll get started."

The main reason why I've been using them in the first place and I still am going to keep using them is because with every single peptide that I'm on, I can stop taking all of them and I would have no side effects at all. And I will admit, I do feel like peptides, especially retidotide, is helping me stay super lean right now while also feeling really good and maintaining a body composition that I've never had previously at this weight. However, I can hop off of literally everything and still be healthy, still be fine. If I was on steroids or SARMs, I would obviously crush my hormones and then as a result, would have to do a PCT and it would be much more unhealthy long term. Along with that, I also wanted to clarify I'm not including NK677 or Enchromafine. I've never taken either of those. I've only taken BPC157, TB500, Cmax, and Solonc, which are brain peptides, and retidotide, which has been my most recent one. And that's only been at 250 micrograms the last three weeks. I lowered it down from one milligram because that was simply just too much for me. And for everyone that's been telling me to get on TRT, I might still do that as more time goes on, but right now I want to focus on doing my next bodybuilding show with strictly peptides and nothing else. And then from there, after the show, reevaluate and see if I want to hop on."

I'm absolutely obsessed with everything that helps you to become healthier and more youthful. I'm going to give you a quick rundown of a few peptides. With weight loss, the world has become more familiar with the rise of the GLP1s, but many people still don't know a lot about peptides. To start with, there are some that can enhance skin and hair, such as GHK copper, epamoralin, and CJC1295. If you have surgery and need to speed up recovery, you can use BPC157, T-alpha-1, or GHK copper. The list goes on. For libido, you can use PT141, melanotan, and KITS peptin. For gut issues, you can use BPC157. For brain issues, you can use C-LENG to decrease anxiety, C-MAX to enhance cognition, and Cerebral Lysine to supercharge neurogenesis. Peptides is a powerful form of treatment to help restore health, beauty, and performance, making it a popular tool to getting people to live their best lives. So there's actually a peptide for everything. For example, BPC157, great for musculoskeletal healing, for brain health, for gut health, for immune health. I'm Dr. Joy.

    "transcript": "They call it a weight loss drug. That's like calling a nuclear reactor a flashlight. Red Etruthide is a mitochondrial reprogramming peptide. Here's the physiology they don't want you to understand. So I'll give it all to you. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin secretion and sensitivity. Fine, but glucagon. Glucagon is the game changer. It's the signal for energy mobilization. So when Red Etruthide binds up to the glucagon receptor on the hepatocytes, it activates something called adenylate cyclase, increasing cyclic AMP, C-A-M-P. This C-A-M-P activates protein kinase, which phosphorylates and activates hormone sensitive lipase in your adipose tissue. I realize it sounds like a lot of big words. Here's the translation. It forces your fat cells, particularly the deadly visceral adipocytes surrounding your organs to hydrolyze triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. It doesn't just stop there. Those liberated free fatty acids are shuttled to the liver. Red Etruthide's glucagon activity simultaneously upregulates carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, CPT-1, which is the best, the rate limiting enzyme for fatty acid oxidation in the mitochondria. It opens up the cellular gates and slam dances the fuel into the furnace. This is your mitochondria, which were sputtering and producing reactive oxygen species instead of ATP now have the most abundant substrate that they require. The electron transport chain kicks into high gear, proton gradient now gets optimal and ATP synthase starts cranking out more ATP. Your brain, which consumes 20%, neuronal function is exquisitely dependent on mitochondrial ATP for synaptic transmission, axonal transport and maintaining membrane potentials. So in Alzheimer's, amyloid beta peptides directly impair complex IV, which is cytochrome C oxidase. It cripples the ATP production. Huh, so Red Etruthide bypasses this blockage by providing an alternative clean burning fuel source, ketones derived from fatty acid oxidation and by upregulating something called PGC1 alpha and it promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, building new healthy power plants. You're solving the problem. They're gonna scream about thyroid cancer and rats. So here's the endocrinology. Rodent C cells express profuse GLP1 receptors. Human C cells, pretty much none. Meanwhile, the visceral fat that Red Etruthide obliterates is a primary source of systemic inflammation. Red Etruthide cuts off the toxic supply at its source. Why is the FDA terrified? Look at the balance sheets, follow the money. Alzheimer's disease, a $15 billion market predicated on failure. Type 2 diabetes, a $500 billion annuity. The depression and anxiety industry, billions in SSRI sales. These are businesses of managed decline. Red Etruthide reverses the core pathology that underlies all of them. It's an existential threat to the subscription-based sick care model. You want the research, comment when and I'll give it all to you. I gotta go, never miss."

    "transcript": "Peptides are one of the most exciting tools in health right now, but most people are overcomplicating them. And here's the truth, peptides are just short chains of amino acids, basically fragments of proteins that act as messengers in your body. They tell your cells what to do. What's the difference between peptides and regular supplements? Well, precision. Supplements give your body raw materials like vitamins and minerals. Peptides are direct instructions. Some peptides signals your body to burn fat more efficiently. Others trigger healing tissue, reducing inflammation. And some stimulate natural growth hormones to support better sleep, skin, and muscle recovery. And fun fact, there are 7,000 peptides naturally occurring in the human body. Insulin is one of the most prescribed medications in the world. And it's a peptide. So is GLP-1, the category that includes semi-glutite and trisepidide. Yep, those are peptides. You see, they're not foreign. They're already part of your biology. Modern medicine has just figured out how to use them in a targeted way. So when you hear about peptides, don't think about magic shots. Think of them as precise signals that can help your body do what it's destined to do. Only better."

So just for reference, I'm 30 and I genuinely feel like I'm 18 again. I have so much energy. I don't even need to drink caffeine anymore. I really just drink coffee now for like the vibe. My skin also looks brighter. It's more radiant. My recovery from workouts is amazing. I'm actually able to do hard workouts and not feel so exhausted after. The reason why NAD works is because NAD is what your mitochondria uses to make ATP, which is literally how your cells produce energy. By your 40s, your NAD levels are cut in half and that's why so many people feel tired, foggy, inflamed. It's basically your cells shutting down. I use injectable NAD because it bypasses your gut and it goes straight to your bloodstream. So worth doing. I use IVRX because they send the NAD plus straight from a pharmacy. So I just like feel really safe getting it that way."

    "transcript": "Stop microdosing red atrutein. Look, GLP-1, when you eat, your gut releases it. Tells your pancreas, hey, we have incoming glucose to release insulin. And it tells your brain the tank is full, stop eating. It's the brake pedal. GIP also tells the pancreas to create insulin. 2018 molecular metabolism. GIP receptor agonism combined with GLP-1 makes your fat cells metabolically more flexible and less inflammatory. But here's why red atrutein is playing a completely different game, glucagon. So alone, glucagon is the fasting hormone. It tells your liver, hey, we need energy, break down glycogen, dump glucose. The engineers of red atrutein saw this not as a bug, but as a feature, a thermodynamic hack. What if you could hijack the glucagon signal in the presence of savage GLP-1 and GIP activity, which are suppressing appetite and controlling blood sugar, the glucagon agonism is forced to find another outlet. Can't effectively raise blood sugar, the defense is too strong. So what does it do? It dumps its energy into thermogenesis. That's why it's so fantastic. Glucagon receptor activation in the liver stimulates adenylate cyclase, skyrocketing cyclic AMP, cyclic AMP activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates this cascade of enzymes. This cranks up hepatic glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. So your liver becomes this fat incinerating furnace. So for all the internet biohackers and doctors that are microdosing, your first thought is, I'm smarter than the chemical engineers, I'm gonna microdose daily? That's not innovation, that's pharmacological illiteracy. Reddit TrueTide has a plasma half-life of six to seven days by design. This isn't an accident. It's engineered through fatty acid side chain conjugation. It binds to albumin, creates a slow release reservoir, the goal is steady state receptor engagement. Microdosing daily is like trying to heat a house by lighting a match every five minutes. You never achieve sustained thermal mass needed for systemic metabolic shift. You're not treating the system, you're pissing it off. You're inducing receptor desensitization, you're training your body to ignore the very signal that you're trying to amplify. And all of your horror stories, I took weekly dose and I was vomiting, microdosing saved me. Let me diagnose that. User error, too many Reddit experts in dosage wars. 2023, Jastraboff proved using triumph trial data that microdosing is for imbeciles and lists adverse events in order. Nausea first, then vomiting, then diarrhea, then constipation, all 100% dose related. I'm trying to help you, you guys. I want you to have the information. The GLP-1 receptor is all over your gut. The nausea isn't toxicity, it's a predictable physiological fire alarm because you set the kitchen on fire with a dose 10 times higher than you needed. The therapeutic window exists, respect it. Listen, I'm the doctor that comes out here every day because they genuinely give a damn about you guys. You want the research, comment dose. I'll hook you up with the research and the manual.

    "transcript": "The biggest bang for your buck peptides. I'm gonna try and fit this into three minutes. Your body fails in three ways. It loses metabolic hearing. I talk about this all the time. Your cells go insulin deaf, declares war on itself with systemic inflammation, and the repair system is out of gas, so it doesn't have the energy to do it. This is the biggest ROI for biology. Read or True Tide is the first one. Most people think it's for weight loss. That is like a side hustle. Here's what it really fixes. Pull up the 2023 phase two trial data in the New England Journal of Medicine. You'll see what I'm talking about. Look past the weight column, and look at hepatic steatosis, fatty liver disease, reversed in 86% of subjects, not managed, reversed. ALT and AST enzymes normalized. HbA1c cratered to non-diabetic levels, averaging 5.2%, by the way. The lipid panel, LDL and triglycerides tanked, and HDL through the roof. This is cardiovascular profile rewrite, and this is just the beginning. The hypothalamus, right, the metabolic control center. In obesity, in insulin resistance, it becomes incredibly inflamed and leptin resistant. It's like the thermostat in your house is broken, and so it's screaming for heat while the furnace is melting in your basement. Read or True Tide crosses the blood-brain barrier and fixes the thermostat. It restores hypothalamic leptin sensitivity. This is why the weight stays off because the operating system is rewritten. This hypothalamic repair, by the way, has massive, very profound downstream effects. I talked about this before. Alzheimer's and I classify dementia in the same category. Type 3 diabetes for a reason. Insulin resistance in the brain creates amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. It's a brain energy crisis. Restoring central insulin sensitivity, read or True Tide isn't just preventing early onset dementia. It's creating a neuroprotective environment for your brain. The weight loss is just the visible tip of a very massive iceberg. The second one, BPC157. It upregulates angiogenesis, builds new blood vessels to damaged areas, and specifically handles TGF-beta to regenerate tissue and not form scar tissue, seals leaky gut. It repairs a leaky blood-brain barrier in kidneys, downregulates pro-fibrotic markers, so it protects against glomerulosclerosis, joints and arthritis, regenerative wrecking ball. It's like the instruction manual for repairs that your body lost. So TB500 is the third one. When TB500 enters your biology, it binds directly to actin monomers. It facilitates cell migration, specifically two injury sites. Just listen to this. Heart repair after myocardial infarction, heart attack, MI, 43% improvement in ejection fraction. Corneal repair, complete epithelial regeneration in 72 hours. Systemic inflammation, NF-kappa-b pathway, downregulation inside of 20 minutes. The goal isn't to live longer sick. You guys know that, right? Like I'm 52, I love how I feel. It's to live longer healthy. I hope you get something out of this because this is for you. Comment big three for the research. I gotta go, never miss."

    "transcript": "BPC157. Listen, it doesn't just do one thing. It does all the things. Watch, fix the system and you fix the symptoms, all of them. Your body has a healing pathway that's centered on nitric oxide, but it has this Jekyll and Hyde personality. You have endothelial nitric oxide synthase, ENOS, which produces nitric oxide that relaxes blood vessels, improves blood flow, it's protective. And then you have the inducible nitric oxide synthase, INOS, which produces massive damaging amounts of nitric oxide during inflammation, leading to a bunch of tissue destruction. So 2014 Journal of Physiology proved BPC157's brilliance. It turns on the healer, ENOS, and it stomps out the destroyer, INOS. It's a molecular bouncer for your biochemistry. This ENOS activation triggers this cascade. Improved blood flow means more oxygen, more nutrients to the damaged tissues. It upregulates growth hormone receptors, making your cells incredibly responsive to your body's own repair signals, promotes the formation of new blood vessels, angiogenesis, to rebuild the supply lines to the injured areas, and it accelerates the expression of key genes like VEGFR2 that are crucial for tissue regeneration, which is what this does. Look at my three biological failures of all disease. Just connect the dots. Watch, Inflammation, 2015 European Journal of Pharmacology showed it doesn't just block one pathway like an aspirin. It shuts off the inflammatory faucet at the source, crushing TNF-alpha. Insulin resistance, 2019 Life Science has proved that by calming the inflammation, it makes your cells listen to insulin again. Better blood flow delivers more fuel, right? ATP shortage, the third one. 2014 Journal of Physiology showed its ability to protect against toxins, which work by destroying mitochondrial function. More oxygen, less damage equals more ATP. Now for the proof that's probably gonna blow your mind. Heart attack, 2018 World Journal of Cardiology, BPC. After the heart attack, dramatically shrinks the dead tissue, reduces scarring and rebuilds the muscle. Kidney failure, so kidneys are filtration systems that are easily damaged by toxins and poor blood flow. 2001 Journal of the American Society of Nephrology examined kidney failure from a toxic drug. BPC 157 normalized kidney function, counteractive blood pressure issues and restored renal blood flow, protecting the very delicate filtration structures from failure. And how about this one? Your brain and your spinal cord can heal. 2019 Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience showed that BPC 157 promotes the regeneration of severed nerves. It accelerated the recovery of motor function after a spinal cord injury. Here's how it works. It does this by protecting neurons from death, promoting the outgrowth of axons, which are the nerve fibers. Pulmonary fibrosis, solved. Protected the delicate alveolar structure, the little sacs, proving it solves conditions like COPD, pulmonary fibrosis and C19 damage. Like I said, BPC doesn't do one thing. It does all the things. Comment first for research and the playbook. I gotta go. Never miss."

    "transcript": "Here we go, GHKCU, copper. It is so much more than what everybody is posting on social media, it's driving me nuts. When you were 20 years old, your bloodstream was this river of this stuff and at 60, less than 20% is left. That's not coincidence, that's a pathology. The disease is called aging. Here's what it does. It binds directly to nuclear DNA and rewrites the entire code. 2003 study in the Journal of Anti-Aging Medicine showed this single tiny molecule alters the expression of over 4,000 human genes. That's a big number, guys. It shifts the entire genetic expression profile from a state of decay to a state of regeneration. Look at your skin. You get a cut in basic biology. Fibroblasts migrate, collagen is laid down, angiogenesis creates new blood vessels, except as we age, it gets slow. 1993 study in wound repair and regeneration showed a 70% increase in collagen synthesis. It doesn't just make more collagen though. It upregulates the precise types. One, three, four, and the specific enzymes, the matrix metalloprotonases to lay it all down and that's just the cosmetic part. Look at the silent killer that most of you guys are ignoring, systemic inflammation. It's this cytokine hurricane that's shredding your cells from the inside out. The body's master inflammatory switch, NF kappa B, is jammed in the on position and GHKCU walks over and kicks the circuit breaker. 2012 study in PLOS ONE proved it suppresses NF kappa B and the resulting storm of TNF alpha and IL-6 just gets shut down. By the way, what fuels the fire? Oxidative stress, free radicals. They're the molecular shrapnel tearing apart your DNA, your proteins, your mitochondria, it's like rust. 2006 biochemical pharmacology showed it directly scavenges the most destructive radical, the hydroxyl radical. Now look at the brain, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, MS, all of this stuff. Modern medicine is obsessed with the plaque and the tau tangles. The problem is neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and a catastrophic failure of neurotrophic support. 2015 Journal of Neuroregeneration Research proved it. It suppresses brain inflammation, boosts the synthesis of nerve growth factor and it protects neurons from apoptic suicide, self-mediated death. Just look at my three biological failures, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and mitochondrial ATP bankruptcy. They are this feedback loop from hell. GHKCU vaporizes the entire friggin' thing. Look at real life. Dementia, it's not just neurons dying, it is vasculature shriveling up, starving the brain. GHKCU's angiogenic action builds new capillaries. Parkinson's, the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Talk about this before. The primary cause, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. GHKCU's mitochondrial protection and the radical scavenging powers, hydroxyl, right, are dedicated security details for those exact issues. Comment copper for all the research. I gotta go, never miss."

    "transcript": "Man, I wasn't gonna do this one again, but semaglutide and terzepotide, you guys need to throw those out. Reditrutide is the answer. Just stop. You guys are being lied to on a biochemical level and you're nodding along. Look at semaglutide first, Ozempic, Wegovi. It's a GLP-1 agonist. It does two things. One, tells your brain that you're full. And two, it tells your pancreas to make insulin. Semaglutide is a synthetic bullhorn version. It's louder, lasts longer, and its primary mechanism is an appetite suppressant. 2021 STEP trials showed 15% weight loss. Yeah, it sounds good. Here's what they don't lead in with. Over 70% of that weight was muscle and connective tissue. You're paying for atrophy. And then they sold you the upgrade, terzepotide, Mongero, ZepBound. You guys need to listen to me on this stuff. GLP-1 plus a GIP. It's a second key for the same satiety lock, a more effective appetite suppressant. Sermout study, 2022, 21% weight loss and the same catastrophic 70% muscle and connective tissue loss. It's a marginal improvement on a premise that's fundamentally broken. They're treating the symptom, caloric intake, while the disease, metabolic dysfunction, just rages right the hell on. These aren't solutions, you guys. This is metabolic duct tape on a system that's rusted through. Just look at the three actual failures that these peptides ignore the real disease. Failure one, systemic inflammation. Your body's inflamed. Your own fat tissue is this endocrine organ pumping out inflammatory cytokines. Semiglutide maybe lowers the inflammation incidentally from weight loss. Retitrutide attacks the NLRP3 inflammasome directly at the source. 2020, cell metabolism, it puts out the fire. Failure two, insulin resistance. Your cells are deaf to insulin. Why? Lipotoxicity. Semiglutide barely scratches the surface. Retitrutide, though, through hepatic fatty acid oxidation. 2022 Journal of Clinical Investigation proved it restores the hearing of your cells to insulin. Failure three, ATP bankruptcy. Your mitochondria are dysfunctional. They can't produce ATP. This is the root cause of fatigue, the brain fog, all the cognitive decline. Semiglutide and terzepatide, don't even touch this. Zero. They actually make it worse by cutting fuel. Retitrutide forces mitochondrial biogenesis, building new, more efficient power plants. 2023, nature solves the energy crisis. This is the unholy trinity of modern disease. I've said this for years. And for decades, we've vilified the one hormone that could fix it, glucagon. It raises blood sugar. People freak out. This catastrophic misread, you guys. We saw the symptom, not the system. Yeah, okay, glucagon tells the liver to release glucose, but its real master function is lipid metabolism. It signals the liver to oxidize fatty acids, to burn fat, not store it. Retitrutide synergy is surgical. Watch, GLP-1 suppresses appetite. Awesome. GIP amplifies satiety. Awesome. Glucagon, this is the workhorse. Incinerates liver fat, boosts energy expenditure, attacks insulin resistance and inflammation head on. The results? Not incremental. Transformational. 2023, New England Journal of Medicine, 24.2% weight loss at 48 weeks. But the weight lost is overwhelmingly fat. Why? Because glucagon's primary action is lipolysis. It tells your body, burn the fat, preserve the muscle. This isn't a minor detail, you guys. This is a game changer. You guys still keep lining up for sema and tersa. Muscle is not cosmetic. It's your body's primary site for glucose disposal. Over 80% of post-meal glucose is cleared by skeletal muscle. Semaglutide and tersepitide create this vicious cycle. You have insulin resistance. You lose muscle. You now have fewer functional glucose disposal units. You become more metabolically fragile. They haven't managed the diabetes. They've given you a blood sugar illusion while making the root cause worse. It's a metabolic Ponzi scheme. This is why retitrutide is a systemic reset. It's not a weight loss peptide. Alzheimer's, type 3 diabetes. It resolves the cerebral insulin resistance and neuroinflammation at its root. NAFLV, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NASH. 90%, 90% reduction in liver fat. It doesn't manage it, it reverses it. Multiple sclerosis. It douses the systemic inflammatory fire that fuels the autoimmunity. Their model is perpetual management. Mine, definitive resolution. They sold you on weight loss. They didn't tell you the cost was your muscle, the very tissue that keeps you metabolically resilient. The number on the scale, you guys, is a vanity metric sold to you by an industry that profits from your sickness. You've been buying managed decline. It's sarcopenia in a syringe. I don't know, how many lives need to be lost because we were too complacent, too trusting, too egotistical and too arrogant on social media to just use the real solution. If you want the research, comment clear. I'll send it all to you. I gotta go, never miss."

    "transcript": "The claim that TB 500 causes cancer because it promotes angiogenesis, that's the biological equivalent of arresting a firefighter for arson because they happen to be outside of a burning building. TB 500, the synthetic fragment of thymus and beta-4, it's the weaponized version of your own body's chief engineer. Your platelets carry thymus and beta-4, so when you're injured, TB 500 is like calling in the A-Team. The primary mechanism is actin polymerization. Actin is the internal skeleton of every single cell in your body. TB 500 is the project manager that tells the scaffolding where to essentially regenerate. What about the angiogenesis then? Listen, angiogenesis is how nutrients get to torn muscle, how it cut on your finger heels. Here, you want evidence? Let's do it. 2012, a study in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics tested thymus and beta-4 in subjects with cancer. The result? Wound healing through the roof, accelerated exponentially, tumor growth, zero, unchanged. The Annals of New York Academy of Sciences founded that thymus and beta-4 actually down-regulates oncogenes. It promotes cellular differentiation, cells becoming specific and organized in functional tissue. Cancer is de-differentiated. It's disorganized. It's chaotic. TB 500 is the very antidote to the state that cancer represents. It gets better. PLOS ONE showed that thymus and beta-4 fragments inhibit the migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells. It screws with their actin scaffolding, putting wheel clamps on one of the most aggressive cancers known to man. The cancer argument is diagnostically backwards, you guys. So listen, what does it actually do? Handles the three biological failures of all disease known to man. Again, one, inflammation. The master switches NF kappa B. TB 500 turns it off. The cytokines that chew through your tissue get shut down. Two, inflammation causes insulin resistance. Journal in Endocrinology proved thymus and beta-4 improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Three, ATP shortage. TB 500 builds new blood vessels. It promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. More power plants, more ATP. Solves the energy problem. Let's go system by system. This is where it gets so fun. Heart attack, 2019 nature. Thymus and beta-4 regenerated cardiomyocytes. It reversed fibrosis. It cured heart failure. Kidney disease. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Thymus and beta-4 attenuated it, protected the nephrons. NAFLD, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis, Journal of Hepatology. Reduced inflammation. Blocked scar producing cells. Kept hepatocytes alive. Stroke, cognitive decline. Dementia, Alzheimer's. Journal of Neurotrauma. Promotes neurogenesis. Grows new neurons. Reduces neuroinflammation. This isn't managing Alzheimer's or dementia, you guys. This is reversing it. Pulmonary fibrosis. It's a death sentence where you suffocate because your lungs are essentially turning to stone. TB 500's anti-fibrotic effect is a direct reversal of the core mechanism. I could do this all day. Tendons, ligaments. No useless scar tissue form. The fear of TB 500 and cancer is the argument of somebody who's afraid of the damn fire truck. You want the research? Comment, life, and I'll take care of you. I gotta go. Never miss."

    "transcript": "Metformin versus MOTC and longevity and diabetes. Listen, okay first Metformin, this disaster that people are using for longevity, its mechanism is this chemical bludgeon. Let me explain this. It walks into your cells, finds the mitochondrial ETC, electron transport chain, which is your personal energy grid, and kicks over the first and most important component of the entire thing, complex one. And then it induces the state of artificial hypoxia, suffocating your power plants. It winds up triggering this panic activation of AMPK, so the short-term benefit is glucose uptake. Long-term cost? You're chronically starving your mitochondria and training them to be weak, inefficient, and sparse. You have less of them. 2022 meta-analysis. Now Lancet, healthy longevity, confirmed it. Metformin users show significant reduction in mitochondrial DNA. And the side effects aren't side effects. You're chemically This is a proven neurotoxin that accelerates cognitive decline and vascular decay. Look at MOTC. The mechanism is so badass, it upgrades the operating system. Watch. It translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional regulator. Its primary target is the folate methionine cycle, the absolute core of one-carbon metabolism. This is the system that's responsible for Methylating DNA, synthesizing neurotransmitters, producing glutathione, which is your master antioxidant, right? And generating nucleopeptides for repair. And it also activates AMPK. 2015 cell metabolism. Watch. Here's how badass MOTC is. They fed mice a high-fat, obesogenic diet designed to induce metabolic syndrome. The control group got fat, got sick, diabetes, and the treatment group received MOTC. And the result? No weight gain, no insulin resistance. Their physiology was completely untouched, protected. They were literally immune to the disease. MOTC doesn't do that. It manages the disease once you have it. MOTC prevents you from getting it in the first place. MOTC through B12 deficiency raises homocysteine, which shreds your myelin sheath and endothelial lining. MOTC, on the other hand, crosses the blood-brain barrier, up-regulates BDNF, which is the miracle grow for your brain, enhances CREB signaling, and acts as direct neuroprotectant. One protects your brain. The other helps dismantle it. By the way, cancer thrives on dysregulated glycolysis, specifically the Warburg effect. MOTC promotes healthy oxidative phosphorylation, better functional metabolism. Research in oncogene proves it. It activates AMPK-mediated pathways that suppress tumor proliferation. How about this one? Diabetes, which is what people take metformin for originally. MOTC doesn't lower blood sugar. It makes elevated blood sugar a physiological impossibility. Here's how. The cell is no longer deaf, it's no longer inflamed, and it's no longer starving. It's awake, calm, and powered. The disease has nowhere to live. Comment sugar for all the research. I gotcha.

    "transcript": "Alright, glutathione. You guys asked. So, by the way, you get glutathione wrong and nothing else in your body works. Here's what it does. Your mitochondria, right, are these power plants. They burn oxygen for energy. That fire creates exhaust fumes, reactive oxygen species for radicals. They shred your cell membranes, mutilate your DNA, just trash your system. This is oxidative stress. The literal physical corrosion of your body. It is aging and every chronic disease, period. Glutathione is the sacrifice. It steps in and it takes the hit. It gives an electron to pacify the radical. It becomes useless. But then here's the genius. An enzyme, glutathione reductase, slaps a new electron on it and sends it back out to go to work. It's like this renewable, self-charging superhero. But a lot of you guys are bankrupting the hell out of your system. Here's how. Watch. Stress. Cortisol. 2008 study. Biological psychiatry proved. Chronic stress nukes glutathione in your prefrontal cortex by over 40%. You're worrying your brain into literal oxidative damage. No kidding. Second, your diet. You're eating nothing. Glutathione needs raw material. Cysteine, glycine. It needs cofactors. Selenium, big time zinc, B vitamins. 1995 study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed even a marginal selenium deficiency cripples the entire system. Third, bunch of toxins. Your liver slaps glutathione molecules on every single toxin. Alcohol, pesticides, drugs to flush it out. You don't have the glutathione. You can't do that. Fourth, you guys and your damn NSAIDs. 2001 paper, Free Radical Biology and Medicine showed NSAIDs don't just reduce inflammation. They induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, depleting glutathione. Fifth, aging and disease. As you age, production tanks. Disease burns through your reserves. 2011 review and aging research reviews showed the lower it gets, the sicker you get, the sicker you get, the lower it gets. It's this feedback loop of failure. So no glutathione. Watch what happens. Your liver fails to detoxify. Your brain. 2017, JAMA psychiatry. Study linked low hippocampal glutathione directly to memory loss and depression. Your lungs lose their first line of defense and your kidneys fail. Every chronic disease, cancer, diabetes, dementia boils down to rampant inflammation, insulin resistance and mitochondrial collapse. Watch this. 2011 paper in Cell Cycle and 2018 in review in Mitochondrion showed glutathione addresses all three. Shots off the inflammatory master switch, cleans the corrosion off your insulin receptors and armor plates your damn mitochondria. Here's what actually works. Outside of sub-Q glutathione, anacetylcysteine, which is the precursor. It's the rate-limiting brick. It's what they use, by the way, in ER to save people from Tylenol overdoses. It works. Selenium. This is the bullet for the gun. Without it, glutathione is useless. Alpha lipoic acid takes the used up glutathione and slaps a new electron onto it, putting it out back to work. You guys, glutathione is not a supplement. It's your most powerful weapon of your physiology. You want all the research? Comment weapon. I'll send it all to you, including that supplement list.
