    "transcript": "Peptides. Celebrities, athletes, biohackers, everyone seems to be talking about them. So what are they really? Hi, I'm Dr. Sogal. I'm the functional medicine and longevity expert here at Concierge MD. I'm also a specialist in peptides and have been using them in practice for many, many years. I'm going to start breaking them down for you in our new series called The Peptide Playbook. Peptides are tiny chains of amino acids, think proteins, that basically just tell your body what it already knows how to do. Recover, rebuild tissue, lose fat, build muscle, lots of different things. Peptides have been around for a long time. They're technically not new drugs or new meds. Insulin, which we create in our body, is a peptide. But a lot of these newer ones gaining popularity are because they're being used as biohacks and they're incredible for longevity. Unlike medications, they just signal your body rather than replacing things in the body, which is why they're gaining so much popularity. Everyone wants performance and longevity support without feeling like they're an unbunch of medications. In this series coming up, I'm going to break down everything you need to know about peptides. What's hype, what's not, and I'll be answering all your questions about them."

    "transcript": "Everyone says take peptides, but no one really informs you on where to start and how to take peptides So I'm going to inform you first things first find a trusted site Make sure it's third-party tested and also look at the purity levels because if you're finding purity under 99% Then you probably should not take it The next thing you should ask yourself is what peptide do I want to take and what do I want to improve on? For starters if you want clear skin take GHK If you want to get a tan take MT2 known as Melana tan 2 if you want to get lean and look shredded Lose fat take GLP 3 also known as red trutide And there's so many different peptides with a variety of benefits The next step is getting your syringes in your BAC water and these are so easy to get I get the syringes off Amazon And then BAC water off either Amazon or the website I'm buying off of the next thing you want to learn is how to reconstitute your peptide with the BAC water Super easy all you got to do is look up on YouTube and there's videos on tik-tok that will inform you and help you out Lastly and most important of all in my opinion is storage Personally, I store my peptides in the fridge and that's what I think everyone should do because that has the best effectiveness You want to avoid direct sunlight no matter what because the peptides will degrade and lose effectiveness Anyways, I hope this helps and do your research before you buy and know what you want to take"

    "transcript": "In two to three years, peptides are going to be totally legal like they are now, but they're going to be marketed for human consumption and they're only going to be sold by three or four big pharmaceutical companies and they're going to be three to four times more expensive. And this genuinely saddens me. Ever since I got that Wolverine stack to fix my knees, that BPC 157 and TB 500, and then I went crazy when I realized that they work, have minimal side effects, if any at all, depending on who you are, and the results are insanely good, I realized something very quickly like, also I became an affiliate and I saw how many people actually use peptides. It's not about the health of the general public. Are they safe? Is it this? Is it that? Of course they're safe. It's about the control of how much money people are making and who's making it. In two to three years, these peptides are going to be so much better than they are now, even though that's hard to imagine, that people are going to be, it's going to be like the normal thing. It's not going to be like, oh, go to the pharmacy and get, you're going to be able to go get them off of a shelf somewhere. I promise you. You can essentially do that now. You just got to order it to your front door and reconstitute it. The amount of people who have hit me up, like if you need some help, inbox me. But the amount of people who have hit me up, I've told them exactly what I think they should, you know, just giving them their recommendations, helped them reconstituted, help them with dosage protocol and all that, who come back to me a month later like, yo, this shit really changed my life. Like, I can use my knees. I can hoop. I can do this. I can do that. This Wolverine Stacks fixed stuff that I didn't know was hurting. I got so used to living in pain that I just thought it was normal and all of a sudden I'm not. I'm waking up with no inflammation in my body. I didn't realize how inflamed I was. Yo, John, I've been on this Retta for a month. I've lost 20 pounds without trying. Like I know that this all sounds like it's too good to be true. Ask anyone who's tried it. And it genuinely, I'm like, man, it's not often that someone like me can find something that I'm passionate about and it works the way it does and I make the money from it the way that I make it. And I truly believe in it. Like I have my family on peptides. You understand what I'm saying to you? Yeah, I love y'all too, but I love my family 37,256 times more than I love y'all. You think I got my parents on peptides, my wife on peptides and like I saw somebody who was like, oh, you're just trying to sell this. You don't know what this is doing to people. I've done extensive research and my loved ones are on them. From me."

I measured myself just earlier 176.5 that is one and a half centimeters of growth in 19 days. It's actually crazy. I haven't grown For like the last year. I thought my growth place would close or like I just didn't have any growth left in me I thought I would suck forever at 175 But now because of peptides we are actually growing it is actually great peptides are not coke They actually work. So if you're thinking about growing taller if you're like a man that like I was Don't be afraid to hop on because these are super safe and yet super effective like low-key all my days It is so good. Holy forehead Anyways, one and a half one and a half centimeters of growth And I'll pull it out"

I was stuck at 5'6 since 8th grade, so 2021, and now I am 5'8\". A little bit over 5'8\", so that it increased my weight cap for classic physique. My clavicle has grown and I have pictures to prove it and also I do have measurements On top of my delta growing, so my frame just has gone a lot better from taking HGH. My sleep is phenomenal. I would still take HGH even if there was no other benefits. Sleep is just amazing. I wake up so much more refreshed even on 6 hours or 5 hours sometimes. HGH is overall my second favorite compound from testosterone. I definitely think it is a staple for every single cycle that I want to take from now on. But yeah, not everyone is going to have growth from HGH. I did have lower E2 since I was taking primo, or I still am taking primo. So that may have been a consideration to think about. And also my growth rates were still open, thankfully. And now I am 5'8\", with above average clavicle length. Fall for more."

    "transcript": "This is the peptide that LuxMaxers are using and people are obsessed with right now. GHK2 is a natural peptide that binds copper and triggers collagen production, giving your skin that firm, youthful glow. It boosts growth factors like TGF-BETA1 to speed up tissue repair and reduces inflammation and oxidative damage at the genetic level. LuxMaxers and biohackers love it because it's one of the few compounds that actually helps rebuild skin, not just cover up damage, and it's backed by real science. Over 70 published studies. Overusing, it could mess with your copper balance, though no solid human studies confirm this yet. Injectable is the way to go if you want 100% bioavailability. That's why GHK2 acidate formulations are popular. They offer more precise dosing. Used wisely, this peptide is one of the cleanest for skin health and repair. It's what celebrities, models, and smart biohackers are quietly using to stay 10 years younger. Want a full breakdown or a product guide? Drop a microscope emoji in the comments."

    "transcript": "Stop messing it up. You're spending money on this. Let me show you how to reconstitute Retta. Backwater, Retta. I'm just gonna use an insulin syringe because it's what I have. Pop off both tops and you're going to alcohol swab each one. We are going to be using a 100 unit insulin syringe for the backwater. I want you to pull out 100 units. Just make sure no air bubbles. Grab your bottle of Retta. We are doing a five milligram here. I want you to put this in at a slight angle to where the backwater will run down the side of the peptide. A lot of times it'll just naturally pull in by itself, but just don't shoot it abruptly directly into the powder itself. Let it drip down the side of the vial. Once that is all in, just go ahead and grab the vial and you can just rotate it in your fingers. You guys can take it, roll around in your hands like this. Just make sure you are not shaking it. And that powder will completely dissolve on its own. Now with this concentration, how do we dose it? When you actually pull back from the Retta vial now, every 20 units is going to be one milligram of Retta. One milligram is 20. Two milligrams will be 40 units. And then of course you guys can titrate up or down depending to dose preferences. So where do you get it? Everything I get is from Nova Pepsilare, a trusted third party company. You guys can go online and see all these sites there, but that is my trusted source as needed."

    "transcript": "I've generally just had one of the most scary life experiences using peptides and this is the thing I think people online and social media give this you know misinterpreted idea that peptides are just great You know, they change how you look the way that you feel You know, they make you feel amazing this that whatever and they do do that But no one speaks about the downsides the things that can go wrong You know the things that aren't good about them because they were research chemicals at the end of the day, right? So this is my experience over the last five days and what went massively wrong I started taking a cycle of retrotide, you know to lean out to get those hollow cheats Who doesn't want to do that and just look and feel a bit better about yourself GHK see you because supposedly is the pretty peptide make your hair a little bit darker make your facial features stand out The skin and all the other stuff that comes along with it Well Anna tan so you know make yourself look a bit darker because everybody looks better with a tan and a bit of HTH Because that's what I'm mixing with my current cycle Anyway, so I've taken these about five days ago didn't really notice much apart from you know, the GHK see you being copper It's stung a little bit when I was putting it in and actually it left the mark You know for a day where I was injecting it into my side Wasn't too worried about that I knew about that but this is the thing and this is the scary bit after day three I started getting this into digestion feeling and I thought maybe it's because you know I'm eating too many carbs or you know, maybe it's just my body getting used to peptides day four rolls around and it starts Get pretty bad. I'll just say I have a lot of trapped gas inside me constantly farting constantly going to to it constantly burping Feeling like when you swallow a tablet, you know, it doesn't go down fully It's just stuck here constantly and then day four day five rolls around and this was yesterday I went to sleep about midnight maybe 1 a.m. Woke up at about 3 4 a.m. Could not sleep struggling to breathe It felt like someone was just constantly applying pressure to my stomach, you know constantly having to go to the toilet Constant burps, you know, it was not great. It was horrible In fact, there's no struggling to eat and this went on for you know The next 24 hours I had to spoke to my coach which watching I had at the time I was like this is happening and he said It's probably because your peptides are not real and this is the thing the peptides I bought were lab tested You know, it's very easy to fake results So people that buy from you as I say with peptides in the popularity and the size they're growing on social media So many people are capitalizing off, you know making these fake peptides to be something that they're actually not and that's the thing when you're injecting If you've got no clue what you're injecting right because you may think is Rettatrutide But it could be because I'm completely other random cooked up shit in a Chinese lab that you're injecting into yourself And that he said was probably the cause of it. So I've jumped off for the last, you know 24 hours Thankfully, I'm feeling a lot better It goes to show you need to be super super careful with where you're getting from your trusted source how much you're injecting And whether you actually want to do it as a whole because you know now that I think about it I'm definitely gonna do more research and jumping in the first random thing that I see"

And on today's episode, we have Glow. Now this pretty blue liquid contains GHKCU of what is known as the pretty peptide or what I call Smurf Juice, BPC157 and TB500. Now the GHKCU is really gonna improve your skin tightness. It's also gonna reduce stretch marks and it gave me a brand new hairline. Honestly, like I can't thank GHKCU enough and the BPC157 and the TB500 are gonna be great for recovery. If you have any injuries, wounds, ligament damage, tendon issues, anything like that, it's great at reducing discomfort as well and basically just healing you from the inside out. So you've got the GHKCU to heal you from the outside and you've got the BPC157 and TB500 to heal you from the inside. And this is not medical advice, it's for research purposes only, but Glow is amazing."

BPC157, it's actually the one peptide you can take orally because it specializes in gut healing. What about hair loss? GHKCU is amazing. We're seeing great results, especially when it's paired in the glow stack with TB500 and BPC157. Okay, what about issues sleeping? Everyone is loving Penelon. It's a mood peptide for anxiety and depression, but it's really helping with quality of sleep. What about low libido? Ooh, we got the PT141, and you can bonus take it as a nasal spray for people who don't like those pokes. What about for those who just wanna get hotter? Ooh, you gotta do the glow stack. That's the BPC157, TB500, GHKCU, everyone's getting on it right now. What's a good peptide for recovering after a surgery? BPC157 paired with TB500 is like the best for anything recovery. And last one, of course, fat loss. You got your GLP ones, they are by far the best thing, but you gotta do it right."

Let's get into it. I think it's definitely possible, more than possible. I think it's inevitable based on the biology. These people who are taking it chronically to treat chronic aches and pains or they think they're supporting recovery from exercise and they're taking a Wolverine blend or glow, clove, BPC, TB. I think it's inevitable without a doubt and you know, I'm not gonna argue with anybody about this anymore because they're like, oh well there's no research, there's no studies. With TB4 there is plenty of data out there that demonstrates very clearly the relationship between administration and the development and progression of malignancies that increased potential for metastatic disease. With BPC 157 there's a total of two studies. One didn't even look at tumor progression itself as an endpoint. They only evaluated Cacaxia related to cancer which it helped in. The other was in a petri dish they looked at melanoma cells and it did help in that petri dish because there's no access to a blood supply. So angiogenesis is thrown out the window basically. And again, the people that say there is no risk are people who do not understand the biology. They do not have any idea about the biology. They have no training, they have no experience, they have zero, nil nada. You know, and they'll sit on whatever, you know, I don't even know. But it's useless arguing with people who don't understand the biology, who've never looked into the biology. When these mechanisms are so well characterized, there's so much research regarding the mechanisms involved that clearly outlined the relationship, we know what's gonna happen. It's like saying, hey if you jumped off a building that was 500 feet tall would you or would you not completely at the bottom? You don't have to go and try that to prove it. We could all say with unanimous certainty that yes, absolutely without a doubt. These people, the same people, their argument would probably be, well we have no research regarding you specifically jumping off the top of this building. So it's unclear. We can't really say. I don't know. It's foolish. It's foolish. It's truly foolish. And it's unfortunate because people are listening to people who have no background, no education, no experience, nothing. No, no, like it's unfortunate. It's really unfortunate. And what's even more unfortunate, actually, I'm starting to see a trend, is that you have more doctors now who are getting involved in the peptide space and they're recommending things that are based on that are based on things that influencers are putting out. Like, oh use Wolverine for chronic aches and pains. And that's really disappointing. Because then it's like, dude, you have the experience, the knowledge, the background. You have the foundation. Why don't you use it instead of listening to shills on the internet? But hey, that's the nature of the world that we live in today where influence and followers mean more than education and experience. And it is what it is. But if you would like to learn more about these things, these peptides, about what they do, how they work, and how to go about them in the safest way possible, come join us over in the school community. Think is in my bio. We cover pre-clinical trials, clinical trials, and evidence-based protocols to help you understand everything you need to know. Keep yourself safe. We'll see you over there, Dr. Bhati out."

These compounds are great and they're often tatted for their potential to enhance performance and well-being, but honestly, they lack any extensive long-term human data. So here's the key. If you're actually going to consider using peptides, don't do it alone. Consult with a qualified physician or healthcare professional and they can give you that personalized guidance to weigh the risk and benefits for your specific situation. Remember, what works for one person might not work for you. So professionals also have the ability to license and order these peptides from a compounding pharmacy versus the underground. You don't know where that came from. It's not regulated and you're putting that into your body. So ultimately, a doctor, a medical professional can really help you navigate this complex landscape and ensure that you are making informed decisions about your health. So remember to stay safe, stay informed, and follow me for more."

    "transcript": "If I had to start my peptide journey all over again, here are the two peptides that I would make sure I invest in. The first one is red atriotide. This is a GLP-3 and it is incredible for weight loss. It's incredible for your whole entire body. There's tons and tons and tons of studies coming out on how it helps the brain, it helps inflammation in the body, it helps liver function, it helps joint pain. There's just so much research coming out with red atriotide that it is seriously one of the most top tier peptides that you could invest in. The second one is obviously going to be GHK-CU, and that is because of its incredible anti-aging benefits as well as the tissue repair and all the amazing functions it has internally for your body. So it's going to make you externally look more youthful and rejuvenated as well as help you internally with its anti-aging properties. So red atriotide and GHK-CU are two powerhouse peptides and when used together, you are going to feel like the best version of yourself. Your peptide journey doesn't have to be complicated. You don't need to invest in 50 different peptides to see extreme benefits and results. You just need to invest in the peptides that are best for your body and what your needs are. I hope this helps and if you have any comments or if you have any questions, DM me, shoot me a comment below and I'll be happy to help. Bye."

    "transcript": "Which is actually better for anti-aging? Calcium AKG or NAD? This is one of the biggest questions I get and as a triple board certified physician in internal medicine, obesity medicine, and lifestyle medicine, let me break it down for you simply. First we have calcium AKG. This is the one that directly targets your biological age. Your natural AKG levels drop almost 90% as you get older, especially after 40. When you take it, your cells literally start acting younger. AKG supports collagen production, skin firmness, elasticity, lowers your inflammation, boosts your metabolic health, and even helps joint mobility. Clinical studies have shown that AKG can reduce biological age by up to eight years. So if you're dealing with inflammation, dull skin, collagen loss, or feeling like you're aging faster than you should, AKG is the one that helps with that. Now NAD is a little bit different. It is your cell's energy source and repair molecule. It activates your blood, circulates, supports DNA repair, and improves mitochondrial function. It also boosts mental clarity and focus. So if you're feeling tired all the time, mentally foggy, dragging through the day, or like your body just doesn't recover like it used to, NAD is the one that helps with that. So which is better for anti-aging? Both. You'll get lower inflammation, smoother skin, and reduce your biological age with the AKG, and more energy, clearer thinking, and stronger cellular repair from increasing your NAD levels. The truth is they work differently, but they work incredibly well together for aging well. Nature newborn is the only brand that I have found that actually combines both an NAD precursor and AKG in one supplement that is highly bioavailable. And you don't have to worry about hunting down separate supplements. It's clean, third party tested in the US, no fillers, and you only need two capsules, 1,000 milligrams a day. If you want to check it out, I'll leave the link down here below. And if you still see that little shopping cart icon, that means it's still in stock. Grab it while you can."

    "transcript": "Are peptides safe? The answer from a doctor who uses them himself. Peptides are one of the most powerful tools in modern medicine, but most doctors don't understand them and haven't been properly educated about them. The truth, when used correctly, peptides can be totally safe and effective, and in many cases, more effective than traditional pharmaceuticals. I use them personally, and I prescribe them to many of my patients to help them lose fat, to help them sleep better, to help them have better energy, and help them recover faster among many other reasons. Peptides can be extremely effective in your longevity plan, but you need to make sure that they're properly produced and sourced. What most physicians don't know is that there are many peptides that are actually FDA approved. Examples include thymosin alpha-1, pesimoralin, sermorelin, insulin, semaglutide, trisepatide, and there are others. Now, there are plenty of other peptides that have never been through an FDA approval process, but that doesn't mean that there isn't data to support their use. There's research looking at many of these peptides, and although it may not be as robust as a full FDA trial, that research is out there, and tends to be scattered through the medical literature. Because there's no drug rep bringing that literature to traditional physicians, many physicians are often ignorant of this research. Where peptides are produced is very important. There are many online websites that sell peptides directly to consumers, and are specifically for research only. Many of these websites will say, these peptides should not be injected or consumed by humans, period. So you need to be eyes open on where you get your peptides. Peptides can be produced in a safe way with third-party testing for both sterility and quality, through quality compounders. Getting peptides from someone who knows where they're produced, who's familiar with the regulatory process, and making sure that these peptides are produced for human consumption is of utmost importance. If you'd like to dive deeper into peptides, let me know in the comments."

And no, you don't have to spend hundreds of dollars injecting yourself every night when you can use this topical serum. Last 22 days I've been using these topical peptides and documenting the journey for you guys to see if they actually work or not, and they absolutely do. Uses hyaluronic acid to boost your collagen production as well as repairing and tightening your skin barrier. This means that your acne scars are going to be fading faster, your pimples are going to be gone, your redness and irritation are going to be reduced, your skin is also going to be glowing, and your texture is going to be heavily improved. You can literally see my skin glowing in the light right now, it was not doing that before. GHKCU is one of the only peptides that do work topically. If you want to accelerate these results you can use a derma roller or a derma stamp, but everyone's saying a derma stamp is better because it can cause less problems. I was lucky enough to get this through a discount link and I'm going to leave that same link for you down here if you guys are trying to save some money."

So let's end this once and for all. As someone who's used it for around six or seven months and skin used to look like this and this, here's what you need to know. I'll just go ahead and say this right out of the gate. Pinning it is going to be a little bit more effective. It's more bioavailable, but as someone who's used both for the same amount of time, I've achieved just as good of results applying it topically on my face. And there are multiple studies that show that as well. So my recommendation for anybody that's watching this video, try out the serum first because it was literally a night and day difference for me. Save yourself a whole lot of time, money, and pain, because I don't know if y'all have ever pinned GHKC before, but it actually stings. You don't have to take my word for it or other strangers on the internet. I mean, I get it. Just try it out for yourself, but make sure you are getting one of the good serums. This one is made in the USA and is lab tested for all the nasty micro particles and stuff. I got it for like 15 bucks off of TikTok shops. So if you're interested, I will drop that link down below."

    "transcript": "Bro, six or seven weeks, you gotta be fucking kidding me. That's what I was thinking when I saw this video of this dude who is getting a lot of hate online showing his transformation using GHKCU. And he was getting a lot of hate because he was using the topical version. I kept seeing more of the looks maxing pretty boy peptide people on TikTok. And I just kept thinking to myself, there's no way. But you know, as someone who looked like this, I was willing to try anything. So I caved and got it. So I was obviously super skeptical, like I said, but I've been using this stuff for two months now. And clearly it's made a huge difference. I mean, it's insane how many people started to compliment me out of nowhere. And girls were like asking me, what do you do for your skincare? I was like, all I do is use this pretty boy peptide stuff. So all I do is go like this, bang, bang, bang, and rub it in. And my only regret is that I didn't start this stuff sooner because I was struggling for like two years before this. I wasted so much money and so much time going to the dermatologist and getting so many different creams. You do need to be careful though, because there's a lot of questionable brands out there that are made overseas and have no real GHK or copper in there. So this is the brand that I use. It's made in the USA. It's very affordable without sacrificing on quality. I went ahead and linked it down below because that's what I use. And that's what I've had a lot of success with. I usually grabbed like three of these at a time. It makes it cheaper. And then I don't have to constantly restock."

And just to be clear, I'm not talking about gray market. I don't really trust the gray market and I've been scammed in that space. So I just leave it alone. I'm talking about US research vendors with websites. If you go to a website and you look for lab tests or COAs and you don't find any, I would go away immediately. The second way is to see the quality of lab tests they have. The best US research vendors have Genoshek lab testing. Genoshek lab testing is the gold standard and their lab tests are really hard to Photoshop slash fake. The best source in my opinion is eternalpeptides.net. If you guys find a source with better lab testing than them, please let me know. But from what I've seen, I haven't found a source that has better lab testing than them."

I wish it didn't take me this long to actually address the root issue and, you know, stop spending so much money on products. I'm going to the dermatologist and so much time. GHK topically is basically a signal peptide that you could put on on your skin and just rub it on. And then it basically says, you know, hey, you need to repair that you need to fix that. And a super common misconception is that you have to roll it or pin it. But all I do is just go like this and I just take it on here and I just rub it in. That's it. And you just got to do that once a day. But you really got to be careful because there's a lot of brands out there that, you know, don't actually have real GHK in there.

Shooting water directly into powder? That's like blasting icicles. The peptides are fragile, they'll shatter. Then shaking it, that damages them even more. Here's the right way. When you insert the needle into the bottle, you actually want the water to drip down the side. So angle your needle into the side, squirt the waters that the water drips down, and then gently swirl, never shake. The water on the side of the bottle is the most important thing, and then swirl in a second. Your peptides cost hundreds and thousands of dollars. Don't destroy them.

And our body just uses them as great little messengers that say, hey, speed up metabolism, go increase muscle mass, get rid of stubborn body fat. Okay, great. So they're naturally occurring in us. And as we get older and we age, we have less of them. And we also have the signals are not as strong. Exactly. And that's what happens.

    "transcript": "Peptides work way better than most guys realize. I actually almost feel like most guys don't even know about peptides. Or they actually think that they're just putting something unnatural into their body. Absolutely, I hear you. And the thing is peptides are just amino acids, short chains of them, that we already have naturally occurring within our own body. And our body just uses them as great little messengers that say, hey, speed up metabolism, go increase muscle mass, get rid of stubborn body fat. Okay, great. So they're naturally occurring in us. And as we get older and we age, we have less of them. And we also have the signals are not as strong. Exactly. And that's what happens. We even start to lose NAD levels as we are aging, late 20s, early 30s. Those start to drop off. And that's greatly in charge of our ability to decrease mental fog."

I've gotten a lot darker around this region under my eyes, but I do seem to get a lot of redness on my cheeks if I paint too much. As of the GHKSU, nothing crazy so far. Obviously, it does take like two months to kick in properly. I have noticed like a little bit more of a shine, as you can see. I mean, it might just be the lighting here, but outside, it's more of a shine and it's less dull looking. But again, nothing crazy. My pores haven't shrunk and I'm mad. They have a little bit of my T-zone, but obviously, I've been on GHK for a bit longer, if you look at my page. And if you're wondering where I get my peptides from, I've got them from my vendor in the bio. It's not an ad. I just recommend them because they're just high quality and pretty cheap. Yeah, that's today's update. Nothing too crazy. Followed as they updated."

As we navigate modern lifestyles filled with stress, screen time, and nutrient deficiencies, our bodies are in a constant battle against aging. Peptides, like GHK copper peptide, offer a natural solution that's been overshadowed by conventional medicine. These remarkable signaling molecules, reminiscent of stem cells, are vital for maintaining youthfulness and vitality, but our levels drastically decline as we age. Learn how this powerful ingredient can enhance healing, reduce inflammation, and restore skin elasticity\u2014essentially telling your body it's still young! With the rise of compounding pharmacies, the future of medicine may actually be more accessible than ever before, leaving Big Pharma scrambling to catch up. This eye-opening content shines a light on the importance of peptides and their role in promoting longevity through natural means.

    "transcript": "Because the future of medicine is peptides. And here's why. We aren't compounding a drug. We're taking something found naturally in nature, a signaling cell found in your body, just like stem cells, just like amnion, just like all of these crucial building blocks to our health and longevity that are deficient in our foods, deficient in our diet, deficient in our lifestyle. We don't get enough sun. We have too much screen time. We're inactive and all of that shit's taken in our bodies. As we age, there's a precipitous decline in peptides, in building blocks. One example, GHK, copper peptide. We know we have roughly 30 to 40% of the level of GHK in our bloodstream in our 40s that we had in our teens. Why is that important? It's an important signaling cell that tells your body that you're young. Your cells are young. Your skin's elastic. Heal this injury. Heal this wound. Reduce this inflammation. It's safe. It's benign. It's found in nature. We're synthesizing that. That's what peptides are. And Big Pharma got beat to the punch by compounding pharmacies."

    "transcript": "Here are the three most powerful peptides that I think you should consider in 2025. First is BPC157. This is known as the ultimate repair molecule. BPC157 can speed up healing, reduce inflammation, and improve gut health. It's ideal for athletes, busy execs, or anyone looking for faster recovery and reduced systemic inflammation. Next is CJC1295 combined with epimorylin. This powerful combination can naturally boost growth hormone levels. This can enhance muscle growth, fat loss, sleep quality, and overall energy. And it has the added bonus in that it can help slow down biological aging. Finally, thymosin alpha-1. Renowned for its immune boosting qualities, thymosin alpha-1 can help to modulate your immune system, which can strengthen your immune response when necessary, reduce inflammation, and significantly improve resistance to chronic diseases and infections. Incorporating these peptides into your health regimen can profoundly impact not only your health, but also your physical performance and longevity. Comment below if you have questions about peptides and follow for more health and longevity insights."

So personally, when I inject the glow peptide, it does burn, kind of stings a little bit and it stays burning and stinging for like almost 24 hours. I have looked into this, I've looked at other TikToks, I listened to some podcasts about it and to my knowledge, it's from the copper peptide. That's what makes it burn. So I have heard people saying they will either dilute theirs a little more, add more BAC water. I did two MLs, people are saying do three MLs in your vial, so it'll kind of dilute it a little more, but I don't wanna inject more into me, so I'm just staying at two, it's fine. Another little tip that you could do is let your syringe sit out after you've pulled the concentration that you want and let it get warm. I've heard some people saying that because it's cold and your body temps so hot, that can also lead to making it burn. So I notice also when I inject it right here, it hasn't hurt, it of course still burns a little bit, but I let my syringe sit out and get warm and then I did it in the back of my arm and I didn't feel a burn, I tried it out last night. So try it out, let them sit, use more BAC water, but I'm told that it's the copper bee sting is like a common thing that people are saying."

That's not because it didn't work for you, it's because you didn't take it long enough. These people that are hyping it up are lying to you when they tell you it's a three-week transformation. At the core, you're literally reprogramming cellular behavior. Cellular turnover process is going to take 21 to 30 days, but you need multiple cycles to actually see better results. So, the longer you're on it, the more new cells are made under this pro repair signaling. So the biggest waste of your time and money is taking it for like six weeks and then coming off of it. This is what the beauty filter on, I don't fucking look real. That shit works, just don't buy into the hype, actually look into it and give it time."

And my skin has never felt more soft. I feel like I have baby skin again. It also has BPC 157 to heal your gut lining. So it's making you glow from the inside out. So yeah, this is going to be, I believe this is my sixth dose. So I've been dosing it every other day. Another thing that I've noticed is that it's been really helping my eyelashes grow as well. I'm not sure if you can really tell, but overall I am very pleased with it and I'm definitely going to continue it. So this is what it looks like. The glow stack has a GHKCU, it has BPC 157 and TP 500. So all of these things just help with healing, recovery, regeneration. So if you're recovering from a surgery or anything like that, it's really good for that. And it's good for everything. So I inject myself in the gluteus region and I'm doing it every other day just to kind of space it out and last a little bit longer. I am basically injecting 3.5 milligrams of the solution every other day. Yeah, my skin is looking amazing. This is zero filter.

The main reason why I've been using them in the first place and I still am going to keep using them is because with every single peptide that I'm on, I can stop taking all of them and I would have no side effects at all. And I will admit, I do feel like peptides, especially retidotide, is helping me stay super lean right now while also feeling really good and maintaining a body composition that I've never had previously at this weight. However, I can hop off of literally everything and still be healthy, still be fine. If I was on steroids or SARMs, I would obviously crush my hormones and then as a result, would have to do a PCT and it would be much more unhealthy long term. Along with that, I also wanted to clarify I'm not including NK677 or Enclomaphene. I've never taken either of those. I've only taken BPC157, TB500, Cmax, and Talonc, which are brain peptides, and retidotide, which has been my most recent one. And that's only been at 250 micrograms the last three weeks. I lowered it down from one milligram because that was simply just too much for me. And for everyone that's been telling me to get on TRT, I might still do that as more time goes on, but right now I want to focus on doing my next bodybuilding show with strictly peptides and nothing else. And then from there, after the show, reevaluate and see if I want to hop on."

    "transcript": "So what side effects am I going to get from taking peptides? Peptides are amino acid profiles within the body that your body creates already. We create IGF, we create BPC, we create these aminos in the body. So how can you get a side effect from things that your body creates? Well, anything of too much is bad for you, right? But if you're taking BPC, what's the side effect? Recovery, reduce inflammation, gut health increase. There's no really side effect to that. TB 500, increase your tendon repair, increase your muscle repair, really side effect. The only one that I would say has a bigger side effect would be IGF. Now, God forbid if you did have cancer circulating within your body, or you did have something going on and you were taking a high amount of IGF or growth hormone, that's when we could see some causes of side effects. These are things that your body creates already, you're just increasing those to help with the recovery, whether that's sleep, sexual function, recovery itself, or from a surgery, they all help, no side effects."

This is it now. 11 days later, not just your acne, scars, that would usually be on your face for at least a month. Out of there. As darker skinned people, we have different skin problems, but all I do is boop, boop, boop, rub it in, and this kicks your skin into repair mode.

Same principles apply whether you're taking GHK by itself or you're taking it in a stack like Glo. Once you've pulled out your desired amount, let the syringe just rest on the counter. Let it come down to room temperature. It doesn't have to be like an hour plus. And no, it's not going to degrade in that time. We're obviously doing subcube, but instead of doing it right in the front, reach around to your love handle area. That will help with that stinging, but also redness.

Studies have shown BPC to improve cognitive function, gut health, and reduce overall inflammation. Before I dive in any deeper, please check out my sponsor, dxpsups.com, where you can find BPC and much more. Please use my code LEO for 20% off all their products. I have personally used BPC to heal a range of injuries, such as a Granite II Handle Tear, in which I was back to full range squatting in just two weeks. 250 to 1,000 micrograms daily is a pretty common dose, depending on the severity of your injury. For maximum efficacy, injections near the injury site will work best. There is no need to cycle this. This does not interact with your hormones, so use as needed. This combined with TB500 is a godly healing stack. Very synergistic effects, but that will be talked about in a future video."

Other companies are not afraid of that at all, such as Biomiss Labs, which is the company that I've switched over to using. I've also noticed that a lot of the companies that are taking down this specific product are sourced from China, tested in China, and do everything in China. Now what I know is that Biomiss tests everything in the US and it sources everything in the US and maybe that is why they're not taking down their product and they're not worried about it. That is just my guess, I don't know. So should we be worried that our beloved PEPs are going to be taken away from us in 2026? Personally, I am not worried about it and I don't think you should too."

Two is going to be your dosing. So we want to start at the minimum possible dose. So I like to do like 0.5 a week and every two to three weeks after that increased by 0.5. Three is going to be consistency. So you might not be seeing the scale drop at first. There's no reason to like be freaking out. They're just my top three tips.

Most people out there are just gonna tell you, wait until you hit your 40s. That's what I'm gonna be talking about today. My name is Barry. I'm the TRT Sergeant Major. I did 23 years, United States Marine Corps, and I started my TRT journey years ago. By far, one of the best decisions of my life. If you're a man or a woman, you're having low testosterone symptoms, you don't know where to start, comment TRT right now in the comment section. I will reply directly to you, and I can send you the information for how you can get started. Literally get started today. So let's answer this guy's question. Is 30 years old too young to start? The answer is simple. If you're having low testosterone symptoms, you need to get checked. What are three signs that you have low testosterone? You have more body fat, low sex drive, and fatigue or low energy. And those are just three that are super common. And actually after the age of 25, you start losing a lot of testosterone every single year. So I don't like to focus solely on the age because everybody's different. But if you're having low symptoms, you need to get checked. Comment TRT. I'll see you on the other side."

I'm super excited because this is the clothes stack which I have not had access to for a little bit so I got it back and this is going to be my first one in a while. So if you are new they come like this. You will have your medication, your syringes, and your alcohol swabs all together sent directly to your house. You can also come pick them up in clinic if you want to so that I can show you how to draw it up, how to dose, how to administer all of those things and then take it home with you. I have some patients that prefer to do that and that's totally fine. We do that all the time. So this stack has BPC 157, KPV, TB 500, and GHKCU. So it's a great stack for recovery, anti-inflammatory, and also the GHKCU is a copper peptide that helps with collagen stimulation so it helps a lot with hair, skin, nails. So I've actually been pairing this a lot with microneedling and RF microneedling and having a lot better recovery time so the swelling isn't near as bad and then you've got collagen stimulation from the inside with this blend but you've also got collagen and elastin stimulation from the outside with the devices from the procedures so that's been a pretty cool addition that we've tried lately. If you're interested in adding this or talking about peptides at all, you can schedule a consultation with me if you are in Oklahoma or Florida at EliteWellnessTulsa.com."

    "transcript": "If you're trying to get into peptides and you don't know where to start, this is the video for you. Because as somebody who's gotten most of his family members to try out peptides, here's what you need to know. Because you don't want to go from 0 to 100 too quickly. And if you're not really familiar with the space jet, there's one thing you need to do before you get started. Now what even are peptides? What is the purpose of using peptides? It's pretty much like a buzzword at this point. Everybody's talking about them. You've got Rogan, Dana, Brekka. And long story short, peptides are pretty much just like little messengers that tell your body to go, hey, fix this cut, heal this part, repair this. Literally just tells your body exactly where it needs to make the repairs. So if you've got any kind of inflammation, stomach pain, stomach cramps, tears, breaks, etc. The peptides help tell you what to repair. And the easiest one for beginners, which is the one I still take myself to this day, is BPC-157 for a set of very specific reasons. It's got the most research and two, it just makes you feel damn good. It literally feels like you've found a new setting for your body. And my personal favorite part about BPC-157 is that you don't have to use one of these. Most peptides you have to use that. But BPC you can take orally, which is why it's great for beginners. But you just have to be careful when you choose a brand because a lot of them are made overseas and they don't actually come with the correct breakdown of amino acids that you need in the peptide. So take it seriously. Joint pain, inflammation, blood issues, gone, hip movement, flexibility, you name it. Feel like a new human being. You feel like a million bucks. And I'll put the link for it somewhere on this video just because I know there's a lot of fakes out there. I literally almost bought the wrong ones myself."

    "transcript": "If you've been taking BPC-157 and you haven't noticed anything, this is the number one reason why. Because as someone who's been taking it for over a year now, this was the number one mistake that I made and it had a drastic impact in terms of how I actually reacted and if it actually worked or not. And the most ironic part is previous to last year, I didn't even know a single thing about peptides, right? And I kept seeing all of these people talking about BPC-157 and a lot of people even called the Wolverine peptide, right? We're talking ligaments, we're talking tendons, we're talking bones, aches, arthritis, inflammation, soreness, all things that your body desperately needs to look and feel the way that you want to feel on a daily basis. And the reason it was not working for me, like a lot of other people have complained about in the past, is so this was the original one that I bought here. I don't even have the original bottle anymore. But I did some more research on this and the most ridiculous part was this is made overseas. And when I went to find anything about the company, it didn't exist. It was quite literally nowhere to be found. So that makes me wonder, well, the rules overseas are different. So a lot of these companies, they just don't put anything in it. So I ended up doing more research and I found this company that still had the oral version. So I saw a video of somebody talking about how like they've had zero pain. I thought, all right, I'll give it one more shot here. I'll give it one more chance before I just completely give up. So I put the link on this video for the correct one because I wasted a ton of money. And quite literally, it feels like BPC-157 is the gateway to life, to doing the things that you want to do in general, not being limited by the pain and the stiffness and the soreness that you feel on a daily basis. Stick with it for a couple of weeks. Again, this is one of the few brands that I can recommend as someone who's got ripped off."

    "transcript": "Let's talk about GHKCU versus Glow. GHKCU is copper, it's a copper peptide. I like to refer it as more of a cosmetic peptide. Now it's a natural molecule that's already found in our body. Now when you use it for skincare or therapy, it sends the signal to your body to repair. It's gonna tell your skin to produce more collagen, more elastin, that helps smooth out wrinkles, it helps with tightening your skin, it can even help with hair growth. So it's basically an outer beauty support that's gonna help you look younger and more radiant. Now the Glow blend is built completely different. Now Glow is a blend, so it has GHKCU, so you're gonna get all of those benefits, plus it has two other tides, BPC157 and TB500. So instead of just the cosmetic benefits, it's actually gonna work on your whole system. So think repair, inflammation reduction, gut and joint healing, faster recovery. So it's not just cosmetic, it's more regenerative health from the inside out. So let's break it down simply, right? GHKCU is going to be for cosmetic outer beauty. Glow is going to be for regenerative health, inside and out. Right now to support breast cancer awareness month, Glow Aminos is having a sale until the 5th, where you get an extra 15% off on top of the 15 that you can get from using my code, LEXI15 at checkout. So great time to stack up if you need it. Plus 5% is also going to breast cancer awareness, which is awesome too."

    "transcript": "So let's talk peptides. Your body has its own natural repair signal called GHKQ or as they call it the copper peptide. As we age those levels drop and that is when fine lines, dullness, slower healing and even thinning hair begin. Injectable GHKQ brings back all of that. It gives that spark to the signal where the signal is needed. Think of it as giving your scalp, your skin, your hair and all of that a fresh set of instructions. Renew, to restore and to revive. For the skin, stimulates collagen and your natural elastin, your smoother, firmer skin, improves your hydration and glow. Soften wrinkles and uneven skin tone. It speeds up your repair and recovery. For your hair, it wakes up dormant follicles, strengthens thinning hair, encourages new, healthier glow. It's like pressing the reset button on your skin and your hair, turning back time cell by cell and that is why it's called the magical peptide. Fast healing, resetting your age, literally aging backwards in reverse and also helping your hair grow, waking up those dormant follicles. So if you want more information and if you would like to order your GHKQ, get into contact with me, send me a DM and let's chat."

    "transcript": "One of the best anti-aging hacks is adding either NAD Plus and or GHCKU to your micro-needling session. Copper peptides is going to stimulate collagen and elastin which will reduce wrinkles, improve the firmness of your skin, and it also helps repair any damage. NAD is going to give you that cellular regeneration. So if you mix this with your exosomes and your micro-needling solution, you're going to get all those extra added benefits. I am going to put the website that I use. You do have to reconstitute these so you're going to want to make sure you get back water. You will add 5 ml of water to each of these and you can draw out any amount that you want as long as you're putting on topically and then working it in with your micro-needling. And of course you're going to keep them in the refrigerator and they are good for 6 months. Kythe stem cells have been the exosomes that I have been mixing my GHCKU and my NAD with because it also has PDRN, niacinamide, it also has collagen in it along with all the exosomes and growth factors. So this has been a great combo. You can find this in my showcase. And did I mention it's 5 micro-needling sessions for $60? This has definitely taken my skin to the next level. And as always if you have any questions just send me a message."

So either you're in a calorie deficit, it's going to help you with your cravings or in your hunger, and also just overall body composition. It's also great when you're in a gaining phase. Like currently I just started my bulk not too long ago and I'm keeping red atrutein in. Now the reason I'm doing that is the benefits of the blood markers and like just your overall metabolic health, insulin sensitivity, all that keeping me sensitive to food while I'm pushing it up. Two is probably going to BPC TB 500 blend. Now you could use these interchangeably like by themselves or together. These are just really great for healing injuries or overall just kind of bodily maintenance. The anti-inflammatory effects are great and you know it's wonderful for tendon and ligament health. Number three and I guess this would be a peptide is L-carnitine. Now the reason I say this is you know one of my favorites is because of just the energy effects in the gym. I feel like it helped me get a little bit leaner but the pumps are great, the energy is great, the endurance is great. It's just really wonderful when you take an injectable pre-workout. It's probably one of my favorite things to do as far as you know a pre-workout goes. It surely beats any powder you're going to take. Honorable mention would be D-Sip or Delta sleep inducing peptide. Now this one doesn't get talked about a lot but I honestly love it. It's improved my sleep a ton. It helps me to get to a deep sleep and it helps me stay like asleep the whole night. Just super restful sleep."

    "transcript": "All right guys, today I want to talk to y'all about the most underrated peptide in skin and hair health, GHK copper. This little copper peptide has actually been researched for decades and it's been shown to help stimulate collagen and elastin which means smoother, firmer, and more youthful skin. It supports wound healing so it's often used after procedures like microneedling or PRF and it can even improve hair growth by extending the antigen or the growth phase of your hair cycle. Because of its antioxidant properties, it helps calm inflammation and repair damage from stress and UV exposure. The best part is that GHK copper isn't just cosmetic. Studies show that it can actually signal your body's natural repair processes at the cellular level. That's insane. So whether it's a serum, injectable, or paired with other regenerative treatments, GHK copper is a game-changer in modern aesthetics. Let me know if you guys would like to know any more information about it. I'm happy to answer any questions."

    "transcript": "Where are my people at who are stacking the peps? I have been, of course, working on ZetBound since last May. A couple of months ago, I introduced the Ratatouille, which has accelerated the visceral FAT loss and just getting leaner and more trim. So a week ago, I introduced the Tessa Morin, or the Tessa, in trying to work on that deep visceral FAT. When it comes to stacking peps, I really have not been one of those adventurous people who wants to just go ahead and dose every single thing. And now I'm having some of that confusion around the Tessa along with the Ratatouille. Ratatouille, I know, works on my FAT loss. Tessa, I know that a week in is probably too early to see results, but I am starting to see some of that shaping around the midsection. Nothing crazy, but I'm starting to see it. And the reality for me is I know it's not the Tessa, but I also have been started doing that and I'm seeing a difference. I know the Ratatouille does that. So which one is it? I have an idea, but I don't know."

    "transcript": "Mozi is nicknamed the mitochondria peptide, but let's break down what that actually means. So we know that mitochondria are like engines inside your cell. They're the powerhouse of the cell. We learned this in school. They take food and oxygen and turn it into energy. And what makes Mozi unique is that it's one of the rare peptides that actually is encoded in our mitochondrial DNA and not our nuclear DNA. And so that means it's tied to directly how your cells produce fuel. Researchers have found that Mozi can influence something called AMPK and that is energy sensors inside of your body. And when AMPK gets activated, your cells get better using glucose and fat as fuel. Think of it like kind of flipping on your body's efficiency mode. That is why Mozi is being studied for things like metabolic health, exercise performance, and even healthy aging. It's not a stimulant and it's more about teaching your cells how to use fuel smarter."

    "transcript": "So think of SS-31 as your mechanic. MotC is your motor, and NAD plus is your premium gas. Now this is for informational purposes only, and this is not medical advice. So SS-31 has been shown to heal mitochondria. Mitochondria is where energy ultimately stems from. So think of it as your mechanic. They are fixing your motor. The motor is what's driving the vehicle. So the mechanic fixes first the motor. So think of MotC as what's driving the vehicle, what's driving the mitochondria, what's telling the mitochondria, hey, let's push out some energy. So we have SS-31 that's healing the mitochondria, then we have MotC, which is driving the mitochondria. But what good is a really badass motor without premium fuel? Think of NAD plus as the premium fuel. It's what's fueling the mitochondria. So SS-31 heals, MotC is what's driving the mitochondria or driving the car, and NAD plus is what's fueling the mitochondria or fueling the motor. So in my research, I have seen the best effects whenever I am researching first with SS-31, followed by some MotC, then followed by some NAD plus. So guys, I hope this little analogy helped you understand how these three compounds work synergistically, and if you have any questions and hesitate to reach out."

    "transcript": "Okay, three month update on my peptides. We're down around 30 pounds. Skin's great. I was doing the glow blend for about two months, two and a half months there. Stopped taking it. I didn't feel like I needed BPC 157 anymore or TB 500. Still taking MT2. Just got to Arizona. About to get tan. Day one went great. Got a good color on me. GHKCU is keeping the skin super clear. No acne coming up. I'm about to start Tessamerelin and Salenque once I get back from Arizona. So Tessamerelin and Salenque are the new peptides. I will be starting once I get back, but update tan, barely go out in the sun in Washington most of the time. So seeing sun is rare. So being tan without a sun is awesome. About to go hit the zoo in Arizona. Get a good tan going."
