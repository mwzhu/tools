So first off, obviously for materials, you need your reddit vial, your bacteriostatic water, you get your insulin syringes and alcohol wipes off of Amazon. When it comes to reconstituting, I normally just do one milliliter of backwater for all my peps, but for larger 20 milligram and 30 milligram vials, I like to do two milliliter of backwater. When it comes to dosing, we wanna go as low as possible. So 0.5 milligrams a week, every two to three weeks after that, we increase by 0.5, so we're just maintaining a certain amount. If you're wondering what's the correct dose for your syringes, you can go on any peptide calculator online, and it'll show you visually what it looks like. And last off, where to get your reddit. I get mine from Onyx Research. You can click the link in my bio to get it and use code ETHAN10 for 10% off.",

So that's why it's super important that we're prioritizing proteins. We're keeping the muscle in our frame, as well as a good amount of carbs and fats. We're fueling our body properly. Third is gonna make sure we're being consistent. A lot of people get frustrated that they might not be seeing results in the first week or two.

For reconstituting, I like to do 1ml backwater for my 10mg vials, and for larger vials, 20 and 30mg, I like to do 2ml backwater. Step 1. Alcohol swab the Bacteriostatic Water, take your syringe, draw 100 units or 1ml, cap off the Retta, poke the syringe into it, let it just trickle down at an angle, let it dissolve, and then once it's in there, just rub it around in your hands. Once we're ready to use it, let's say we're using a 1mg dose, you can draw to the 10 unit mark on the syringe. For areas of use, you're gonna use your love handles, glute, or legs. Make sure you're rotating your sites on a weekly basis so you don't build up any kind of irritation. The entire process, that's how you're gonna take Retta for the first time.",

What we wanna do is start at .5 mg a week. Every two to three weeks after that, we increase by .5 to we're just maintaining a certain amount. Second is gonna be our diet. Reddit's gonna give us that appetite suppression, but we still need to be prioritizing protein and eating a good amount of fats and carbs so that we're refueling our body properly. Third is gonna be our workout routine. A lot of people don't think that they have to work out on this. Trust me, this is just a tool at the end of the day. It doesn't have to be anything crazy, just three to four times a week resistance training. That way we're keeping our metabolism at a high rate.

So what I like to recommend is 0.8 grams to one gram per pound of body weight. Second is gonna be our workout routine. It doesn't have to be anything crazy, just three to four times a week of resistance training. That way our metabolism's still at a high rate. Last off is gonna be our calorie intake. Yes, RETTA's gonna give you that appetite suppression, but we still need to be eating. Don't put yourself into such a deficit that you're just looking frail at the end of this. What I recommend is just go into a 250, 300 calorie deficit. It will ensure that you're not losing any kind of muscle in the process. Do these three things. This will ensure that you're not losing any muscle on RETTA.",

Step one, you're going to take your alcohol swab, rub the top of the backwater, take your 1ml syringe, let's say it's a 10mg vial of redda, you're going to draw 100 units or 1ml. You're going to take the cap off the redda, alcohol swab it as well, take the 1ml syringe at an angle, just poke it in, let the backwater trickle down, then once it's all the way in there, just rub it around in your hands, don't shake it, if you do, it's going to mess it all up. Let it sit there for 10-15 minutes afterwards, make sure to refrigerate your peps and your backwater, and just like that, that's how you're going to reconstitute your redda for the first time.",

First off, you have to understand that alcohol digests a lot slower in your system on reddit. So you could be taking two, three, four shots, not feeling the moment, and a couple hours later, it's just gonna absolutely wreck you. So definitely pace yourself in the process throughout the night. So what I recommend, you might not be hungry, but get a good meal in and drink at least a liter of water with electrolytes. That way, when you wake up the next morning, you're not waking up with a terrible hangover.",
